# SETUP — guided install, for the agent reading this

You are an AI coding agent. A project administrator has opened a session
on their repository and pasted a link to this file. Your job: install
BestPractice into that repository while guiding them in plain language.
Assume they are not a programmer — explain simply, ask little, and do all
technical work yourself.

## The conversation

1. **Confirm the target.** The repository this session is opened on is
   the project. Tell the administrator, in one sentence, what you are
   about to set up: a practice layer that gives their project durable
   memory, safe concurrent work, and a Getting Started page for members.
2. **Ask exactly two questions**, together in one message, and wait:
   - *What is this project about?* (one or two sentences)
   - *Are there private names or code words that must never appear in
     anything public?* Explain why in one sentence: parts of the practice
     layer can flow back to a public repository, and this list is the
     guard that keeps their private vocabulary out of it.
3. **Install without further questions.** Fetch the public repo
   `https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice` (add it to the session or
   clone it), copy its working tree into `process/upstream/`, then follow
   [process/upstream/INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) §1 using their two answers:
   instantiate `AGENTS.md`, `MAP.md`, `TODO.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`, and
   `GETTING_STARTED.md` from the templates; insert the README agent-entry
   block — but the project comes first (INSTALL.md §1 step 2, practice 38):
   if the repo has no README yet, write its opening from their first
   answer (*what is this project about?*) before the entry block, so a
   reader learns what the project is before anything about how it's
   maintained; apply the harness adapter(s) for the agent(s) in use;
   create `tools/bootstrap.sh`; write `process/manifest.json`; create
   `process/scrub_blocklist.txt` from their answer if the repo is
   private; install the Actions check from `templates/github-actions/` as
   `.github/workflows/bestpractice-docs.yml`; and install
   `templates/pull_request_template.md.template` as
   `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
   Respect the root-hygiene rule (INSTALL.md §1): nothing from
   BestPractice lands at the repo root except the instantiated files —
   all upstream docs stay under `process/upstream/`.
   Run `python3 process/upstream/tools/practice_audit.py` — it must pass.
   Commit everything on a branch.
4. **Walk them through what you made — don't just list files.** Show
   `GETTING_STARTED.md` (what their members will see) and summarize the
   instructions file (the contract future AI sessions work under) in two
   or three plain sentences each. Offer to adjust anything.
5. **Merge for them or with them.** If you can merge, ask "Shall I make
   this live?" and do it on their yes. If only they can merge, give them
   the pull-request link and tell them exactly what to press.
6. **Verify the automatic checks.** After merge, confirm the Actions
   workflow ran. If the repository or organization has Actions disabled,
   give the administrator the exact clicks (repository **Settings →
   Actions**, or the **Actions** tab's enable button) and confirm the
   check appears afterward. Never leave this step silently unfinished —
   the checks are what make the practices enforceable.
7. **Hand them the keys.** Close by telling them two things: members are
   onboarded by saying **"Add project members"** to the project's agent
   (the installed instructions file teaches every future session how to
   guide that), and day-to-day work is just asking questions and
   requesting changes in plain language.

## Rules while guiding

- One step at a time; never assume git vocabulary. "Branch" and "merge"
  get a five-word gloss the first time they appear.
- Do the work yourself wherever an agent can; involve the administrator
  only where the platform requires a human (authorization screens,
  restricted settings, merges you cannot perform).
- Every reply that created or modified files ends with links to those
  files (practice 12 in
  [process/upstream/PRACTICES.md](PRACTICES.md)).
