# The practice catalog

Each practice: the **rule**, **why** (the abstracted incident that motivated
it — every one of these was learned the expensive way in a real repo), and
**install** (what a dependent repo does about it). Templates referenced here
live in `templates/`; tools in `tools/`.

## 1. The repo is the memory; sessions are ephemeral

**Rule.** Everything a future session needs — orientation, open items,
decisions, lessons — lives in committed files. A session's chat thread is
disposable; if knowledge exists only in a thread, it is already lost.

**Why.** Agent sessions (and humans returning after a month) start cold.
Repos that kept context in threads paid a re-derivation tax every session —
re-finding files, re-learning environment quirks, re-making settled decisions.

**Install.** The three living documents below (MAP, TODO, GLOSSARY) plus a
project instructions file (`AGENTS.md`, plus a per-harness pointer file —
see practice 13). Everything else in this
catalog is a refinement of this rule.

## 2. An orientation map, read first

**Rule.** A top-level `MAP.md` indexes the repo: what the key deliverables
are, where everything lives, and — crucially — which supporting documents back
each part of each deliverable. Every session reads it before doing anything.

**Why.** Without a map, every session greps. With one, orientation is one
file read, and "which documents back this section of the deliverable?" has a
committed answer instead of a fresh investigation.

**Install.** [templates/MAP.md.template](templates/MAP.md.template). Keep the
deliverable→backing-docs index current: any thread that adds a document adds
its row.

## 3. A quick index before searching

**Rule.** The project instructions file carries a "check here BEFORE searching
the repo" table: *looking for X → go to Y*, one row per thing sessions
actually hunt for.

**Why.** The map orients top-down; the quick index answers the specific
lookups that recur ("where are the canonical names?", "which script builds the
deliverable?"). Rows are added exactly when a session is observed searching
for something — the index is built from real misses, not speculation.

**Install.** Part of
[templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template).

## 4. Recorded lore: environment gotchas with their stories

**Rule.** Every expensive environment discovery (a package that must be
installed, a tool that silently doesn't work, a path that does work) is
written into a "do NOT rediscover these" section — with the story of what
failed and why, not just the fix.

**Why.** A build tool once failed on every input with a misleading error; two
full sessions were lost to "this tool is broken" lore before someone found the
one missing package. Once the fix *and the story* were written down, the
failure never recurred — and the story is what lets a future session judge
whether the note still applies.

**Install.** A gotchas section in the instructions file
([templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template)), plus practice
13 (encode the fixes as a bootstrap hook so they apply themselves).

## 5. Conventions cite the incident that created them

**Rule.** When you write a rule, record what failure it prevents, inline.

**Why.** "Do X" invites relitigation and misapplication; "do X — we once lost
Y because Z" sticks, and lets a reader judge whether the rule applies to their
case. Rules without origin stories decay into cargo cult or get dropped.

**Install.** A writing habit, not a file. Enforced socially by example: every
rule in the instructions file carries its story.

## 6. A convention violated once becomes an audit that fails loudly

**Rule.** Prose rules are advisory; a non-zero exit is not. The first time a
convention is violated with real cost, promote it to a script that detects the
violation and fails the build/merge — and keep the origin story in the
script's docstring.

**Why.** Every audit in the originating repo exists because its rule was
broken once despite being written down: a status flag not flipped caused a
generated bundle to silently drop updated content; a renumbering left stale
cross-references undetected for weeks; a markdown footgun garbled an external
document. None recurred after promotion to an audit. The binding layer
matters as much as the check: a gate that lives only in a merge runbook
binds only the sessions that run the runbook — a PR merged through the
hosting platform's web UI skips it entirely (a dependent repo's first
member merges bypassed the capture and export gates exactly this way,
2026-08). A required CI check ([GITHUB_ACTIONS.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS.md)) is
the form that binds every path to the default branch.

**Install.** [tools/doc_lint.py](tools/doc_lint.py) and
[tools/practice_audit.py](tools/practice_audit.py) are audits of this kind
(and worked examples for writing your own). Run them before commit; wire them
into the merge runbook (practice 9).

## 7. State lives in one machine-readable registry; documents derive

**Rule.** Any status that scripts or sessions make decisions on (what's
released, what's pending, what version is installed) lives in exactly one
machine-readable registry. Human-readable documents restate it; they never
own it. When registry and document disagree, the registry wins — and an audit
(practice 6) detects the disagreement.

**Why.** Duplicated state always diverges. The worst version: a document
header said one thing, the registry said another, and a builder trusted the
registry while humans trusted the header. The fix was not "be careful" — it
was declaring the registry the single source of truth and auditing drift.
Corollary: **baseline snapshots** — record a content hash when state is
declared (released, synced, approved), and the audit flags any later change
to content whose status claims it is frozen.

**Install.** `process/manifest.json` (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)) is itself
a registry of this kind, with baseline hashes checked by
[tools/practice_audit.py](tools/practice_audit.py). Build your own registries
the same shape: entries + status + hash, one owner, one audit.

## 8. Provenance for generated artifacts

**Rule.** Generated deliverables are never hand-edited and never casually
committed. Each build stamps a **content-derived build code** into the
artifact itself and writes a **manifest** recording exactly which inputs (by
content hash) produced it. Outputs are gitignored and marked binary in
`.gitattributes`; only artifacts that actually shipped get committed
(force-added), alongside their manifest.

**Why.** Two builds minutes apart, with different content, once had to be
distinguished after the fact by spelunking git history. A content-derived
code on the artifact (same content → same code) plus a committed manifest
makes "what exactly shipped?" a lookup instead of an investigation.

A related gap, same fix, different cause: a repo with **no root `.gitignore`
at all** leaves every session that runs the vendored Python audits (practice
6) an untracked `__pycache__/` behind — nobody's build is at fault, there is
just nowhere for the ignore rule to live. One dependent repo's check-in
flagged exactly this after its own merge runbook kept surfacing the stray
directory.

**Install.** Pattern to apply in your builders; no portable tool (the code
stamping is builder-specific). The `.gitignore`/`.gitattributes` stanzas are
in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), which also instantiates a baseline
`.gitignore` from [templates/gitignore.template](templates/gitignore.template)
at install time — ordinary tool/interpreter caches (`__pycache__/` and
friends), so the generated-deliverable globs above have a file to land in
rather than each install having to remember to create one.

## 9. A merge runbook with fixed per-file-class rules

**Rule.** When many branches touch the same shared files, merge conflicts are
expected — so resolution rules are written down per file class, once, and
followed without re-derivation: registries take the **union** of both sides;
logs are **append-only, keep both**; the same content file edited on both
sides keeps both sides' additions (renumbering the side not yet referenced
elsewhere); **generated outputs are never hand-merged** (the side matching
the committed manifest wins; unshipped builds are deleted and rebuilt). The
audits (practice 6) must pass before the merge commits — the audit, not
re-inspection, is what makes fast mechanical resolution safe.

**Why.** Every thread in the originating repo touched the same registry and
index files; conflicts were universal. Ad-hoc resolution was slow and once
dropped a registry entry. Fixed rules plus a loud audit made merges fast
*and* safer than careful manual resolution.

**Install.** Runbook section in
[templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template); adapt the file
classes to your repo.

## 10. Capture in the thread that created the need — before the merge

**Rule.** The thread that develops a capability, a number, a decision, or a
limit is the thread that understands what follow-on artifact it implies (a
document update, a registry entry, an exported practice, a decision record).
Capture it **in that thread, before merging** — as step 0 of the merge
runbook. Never park it in a "for later review" staging document.

**Why.** Deferred capture repeatedly lost both the rationale (the merging
thread didn't know why the matter existed) and the timestamp (priority went
to whoever wrote it down first). A "waiting for review" parking lot caused a
real miss: staged content sat unrecorded for a full cycle because its thread
ended without folding it in. The gate that fixed it: before any merge, ask
"did this thread's work imply anything that must be captured?" — and a grep
for known parking-lot markers, run at thread end.

**Install.** Step 0 of the runbook in
[templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template). The
practice-export gate (practice 14) is this same rule applied to process
improvements.

## 11. Document references are links; approximation is ≈

**Rule.** (a) In-repo documents reference other repo files as relative
markdown links, never bare backticked filenames — docs are read on a web UI
where a bare name is a dead end. New text always links; any thread touching a
document fixes the references in the parts it touches. (b) Use `≈` for
"approximately", never `~` — two stray tildes on a line render as
strikethrough on GitHub, silently garbling text. (c) Links stay plain
markdown — don't reach for a raw HTML anchor to control link behavior:
GitHub's sanitizer strips `target=` (and most other attributes) from
anchors in rendered markdown, so an "open in new tab" link silently does
nothing there (*as of 2026-08*).

**Why.** All born from real bugs: readers hunting for referenced files, an
outward-facing document that rendered with unintended strikethrough, and a
thread that spent two commits converting a link to a `target="_blank"`
anchor and reverting it once the rendered page proved the attribute was
stripped.

**Install.** [tools/doc_lint.py](tools/doc_lint.py) checks all three — it
gates on files changed vs the default branch (the "fix what you touch"
scope, which also protects frozen documents), `--all` reports the backlog,
`--fix` rewrites `~`→`≈` on struck lines; `target=` anchors are reported as
warnings. Requires `cmarkgfm` for exact detection with GitHub's own
renderer.

## 12. Every reply links the files it touched

**Rule.** A session's reply that created or modified files ends with a
"Files touched" list: each entry links the file on the working branch *and*
its post-merge location, with a one-line description. The reader must be able
to open the work from the chat, not merely learn it exists.

**Rendered files get a rendered-view link, not just a repo link.** A
repository link to an HTML file or an image shows source or a raw blob — the
one form of the file the reader did *not* want. When the session's surface
offers hosted private previews (an artifact/paste service the harness
provides), a touched HTML render or picture's entry also carries that
rendered-view link, published from the same file path each time so the link
stays stable across revisions — one preview per file, re-published on
meaningful change, never a new one per reply. Files that are per-recipient
send records are excluded: a hosted preview is a distribution channel, and
those files' distribution is governed by their own send policy.

**Install.** Convention in
[templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template).

## 13. Session bootstrap is code, not memory

**Rule.** Environment setup that sessions need (packages, dependencies,
submodule init) lives in a session-start hook — idempotent, fast when cached,
warning loudly on failure. Routine safe commands the agent runs constantly go
in a permissions allowlist so sessions don't stall on prompts. Where the
harness also supports a hook at the *other* end of a turn, the same
discipline applies in reverse: don't rely on the agent remembering to check
its own git hygiene before stopping — a stop hook that blocks on
uncommitted, untracked, or unpushed work makes that guarantee automatic
instead.

**Why.** The gotchas of practice 4, applied: writing the fix down is good;
having it apply itself is better. The hook is where "install the one package
whose absence cost two sessions" lives as code — and where "don't end a
session with unpushed work sitting in the tree" lives as code too, rather
than a habit the agent has to remember on its own each time.

**Install.** [templates/bootstrap.sh](templates/bootstrap.sh) →
`tools/bootstrap.sh` (harness-neutral; all real setup lives here), wired in
per-harness via [templates/harness/](templates/harness/README.md): a hook
that runs it automatically where the harness supports one (hard guarantee),
an instructions-file directive where it doesn't (soft guarantee), plus a
permission allowlist where the harness has that concept. Where the harness
also supports a blocking stop/teardown hook (Claude Code does; see
[templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/stop-git-check.sh](templates/harness/claude-code/hooks/stop-git-check.sh)),
install that too — some managed environments already provide an equivalent
check outside the repo, but this makes the same guarantee travel with the
practice layer for the ones that don't.

**The bootstrap also checks upstream freshness — detection automated, the
take deliberate.** A dependent repo learns its practice layer is stale only
when someone remembers the periodic check-in, so the hook runs
`checkin.py fresh`: one clone-free `ls-remote` of the public upstream against
the manifest's recorded base, printing a single notice line only when
upstream has moved (silent when current or offline; never a gate).
*Applying* the update stays a deliberate step (INSTALL.md §2): installs are
adaptive, and unattended mirrors are the mechanism class that loses content —
the carry gate exists because even attended ones did.

## 14. The practice-export loop (how this repo propagates)

**Rule.** A dependent repo vendors this repo at `process/upstream/` as plain
tracked files (no submodule — zero runtime dependency, sessions never break
on a missing remote). Install is **adaptive** (generic → specific: an agent
instantiates templates with the repo's subject matter); therefore export is
**abstractive** (specific → generic), and the mapping is recorded in
`process/manifest.json` so neither direction relies on memory. The **export
gate**: before a thread ends, if it improved a generic practice, fold the
abstracted form into `process/upstream/` in the same branch.
**Periodically**, propose accumulated vendored changes back here as a PR.

**Why.** Live coupling (submodules read at session start) breaks sessions
exactly when orientation matters most, and makes capture (practice 10) a
cross-repo operation that gets skipped. Vendored-and-tracked makes the
export a local commit; the cross-repo step happens only at deliberate
check-ins.

**Install.** [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) is the full playbook;
[tools/practice_audit.py](tools/practice_audit.py) audits the manifest
(drift between installed files and their recorded baselines) on every run.
[tools/checkin.py](tools/checkin.py) drives the cross-repo mechanics, and
**both directions of its mirror destroy work, so both are guarded**:
`update` refuses to overwrite unexported local changes, and `push` refuses
when the vendored tree is behind upstream — it deletes files it does not
have, so pushing from a stale tree silently reverts whatever upstream
gained. `--force` bypasses either.

A caution learned the hard way, worth stating because the tooling cannot
fix it: **`--force` on a mirror is a destructive command with no undo.**
Both guards were added after real losses in a single session — a stale tree
that would have reverted two upstream practices, caught only by a human
reading `status`; and then a `--force` passed to bypass the *other* guard,
which silently reverted three unexported additions including the guard code
itself. If you must force a mirror, copy what you are about to overwrite
first. The guard you are bypassing is the one that knows what you are about
to lose.

## 15. The proprietary scrub gate

**Rule.** When the dependent repo is private and this repo is public,
everything under `process/upstream/` must be public-safe **at all times** —
not just at check-in. Contributions are patterns and abstracted lessons
only: no names, code words, identifiers, numbers, or incident text from the
dependent repo's subject matter. Enforcement is mechanical: the dependent
repo keeps `process/scrub_blocklist.txt` (regex per line — its private
vocabulary), and [tools/practice_audit.py](tools/practice_audit.py) scans
the entire vendored tree against it on every run, failing loudly on any hit.
The blocklist itself is never exported (it is a map of the secrets). And a
public repo is **public from its first commit** — content is authored fresh
as public-safe, never migrated from private history, because visibility
flips expose everything a private repo ever casually committed.

**Why.** The abstraction step (practice 14) is a judgment call performed
repeatedly by agents under time pressure — exactly the conditions under
which practice 6 says a convention needs a loud audit. Public git history
cannot be un-published.

**Install.** Blocklist format and gate wiring in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
Scrub before every commit that touches `process/`; re-run at check-in time
before opening the upstream PR.

## 16. Volatile rules carry their dates

**Rule.** A rule whose truth depends on the outside world — the behavior of
an external platform, an algorithm someone else changes, a tool quirk, a
price — carries an inline date: *as of `<date>`* when adopted, updated to
*verified `<date>`* whenever a session reaffirms it still holds. Optionally
add a review-by cadence for rules in domains known to shift. Stable internal
conventions don't need this; their origin story (practice 5) is enough.

**Why.** Age means opposite things in different domains. A convention that
has survived years of internal use is battle-tested; a rule about an
external platform that has sat untouched for a year may describe a world
that no longer exists — teams whose whole craft is tracking a
constantly-retuned external algorithm learn this the hard way, and their
hardest-won rules decay the fastest. The date is what lets a reader apply
the right lens. And it must be **inline**: version control does timestamp
every line, but sessions read file *content*, not commit metadata — in a
repo-is-the-memory system, a date that isn't in the text effectively
doesn't exist for the session reading the rule.

Three corollaries. **The date is the contributor's, not the session's:**
an agent stamping a date uses the human contributor's local calendar date
— the date they experienced when the fact was true or the decision was
made — not the agent session's system clock. The two disagree by a full
day near midnight in most timezones, and an agent's clock is often UTC or
otherwise unaware of where the contributor sits; ask when it isn't already
clear from context rather than defaulting to the session's own date.
**Durable rules earn a record, not just a date:** for a
rule whose age is its authority, capture the tenure and the exception
history inline — *in effect since `<date>`; N exceptions in that time, each
under `<circumstances>`* — because that survival record is institutional
memory that otherwise lives only in people's heads, and it is exactly what
tells a reader how seriously to take the rule. **Rules about model behavior
are the most volatile class of all:** a rule that encodes "the agent's
model handles X this way — route/decide/format accordingly" breaks
silently when the model is upgraded under you, so it carries not just a
date but the model it was verified against — *verified `<date>` on
`<model>`* — and a model change is itself a re-verify trigger, not a wait
for symptoms.

**Install.** A writing habit with a natural audit extension (practice 6):
tag rules with a review-by date or a volatility marker and a small script
can flag overdue ones — the drift check's shape, applied to time instead of
content. The environment-gotchas section (practice 4) is the most
decay-prone rule set most repos have; date its entries first.

## 17. Acronyms are expanded, and a central glossary holds them

**Rule.** A domain-dense repo accumulates far more acronyms and coined terms
than any reader — human or agent — keeps in their head. So: (a) **expand an
acronym on first use** in a document — *long form (ACRONYM)* — and/or carry a
short **"Acronyms" note at the bottom** of a document that uses several; and
(b) keep **one central glossary file** as the living master list, so an
expansion is never re-derived from scratch. When a session uses a term that
isn't in the glossary, it adds it there in the same pass. Identifiers that
already have their own registry (a code table, a component index) are pointed
to, not duplicated.

**Why.** In a repo-is-the-memory system the reader arriving at a document is
usually *not* the person who wrote it and often has none of the surrounding
context — the exact case an acronym silently assumes. One undefined initialism
can make a paragraph unreadable, and the cost compounds: a suite with dozens
of coined two- and three-letter terms becomes navigable only to its authors,
which defeats the point of writing it down. The central list is the same
single-source-of-truth instinct as practice 7 — derive the expansion in one
place, reference it everywhere — and the bottom-of-document note is the local,
low-friction form for the reader who won't leave the page.

**Install.** A writing convention plus one living file (a `GLOSSARY.md` grouped
by theme, alphabetical within a group), and the natural audit extension
(practice 6) is built: [tools/doc_lint.py](tools/doc_lint.py) check 3 scans each
changed document for ALL-CAPS tokens absent from `GLOSSARY.md` — skipping ones
defined inline on the line (`long form (TOKEN)`) and a stoplist of common
words/units — and warns, the same "convention → loud check" shape as its
link/strikethrough checks. Warning-only and auto-disabled when the repo has no
`GLOSSARY.md`, so it never blocks a repo that hasn't adopted the practice.

## 18. Filenames have no version suffix; the VCS is the version

**Rule.** A new file is named for what it *is*, with no `_v1` / `_rev2` label —
the repository already versions every line, so a version number baked into the
filename is redundant at best and misleading at worst (it goes stale the moment
the file is edited without a rename). A numeric suffix earns its place only when
two versions must **coexist** and a reader has to tell them apart (a successor
kept beside its predecessor for history); then it is the *new* file that is
suffixed, not the old one retro-renamed. An existing suffixed backlog is left
alone — bulk-renaming breaks the very references (links, records) the names are
load-bearing for; drop the suffix only from a file already being moved for
another reason, fixing its references in the same pass.

**Why.** "`_v1`" is the classic redundant-with-VCS habit: it answers a question
the version-control history already answers, and unlike the history it does not
update itself — a `_v1` file edited fifty times still says `_v1`, so the label
actively lies. It also invites a rename on every real revision (churning the
references), or worse, a `_v2` copy that forks the file and splits its history.
Naming for identity instead keeps one stable handle per document and lets the
tool whose job is versioning do the versioning.

**Install.** A naming convention; no tooling needed. The one judgment call —
"do two versions genuinely need to coexist?" — is rare and deliberate, so it is
left to the author rather than a lint.

## 19. Computed numbers live in scripts; documents embed sync-gated generated blocks

**Rule.** When a document presents content that a script computes — a summary
table, a cost rollup, a comparison grid — the document region is wrapped in
invisible sentinels:

    <!--gen:NAME-->
    ...generated markdown...
    <!--/gen:NAME-->

the script gains an `--emit NAME` mode that prints exactly that block, and the
(document, block, script) triple is registered with a small sync tool
(`tools/doc_sync.py`). The bare tool run is a **drift gate** — it fails loudly
when the document's block no longer matches the script's output — and runs with
the repo's other pre-commit gates; `--write` regenerates the blocks in place.
Never hand-edit inside a generated block: the numbers live in the script, the
document is a render target.

**Why.** Derived numbers quoted in prose silently lag the source that computes
them. Nothing breaks; a human just has to *notice* the staleness — and in one
dependent repo a headline comparison table lagged the scripts behind it until
the repo owner had to ask "did you update the table?". The reminder itself was
the bug: consistency between a computing script and the documents quoting it is
exactly the kind of convention that must become an audit (practice 6), because
it is mechanical to check and embarrassing to miss. The sentinel form matters:
HTML comments render as nothing on hosted markdown, so the plumbing is
invisible to readers, and the block boundaries make regeneration deterministic
(no fuzzy matching against drifting prose).

**Install.** Copy `tools/doc_sync.py`; register pairs in its `PAIRS` list; wrap
the generated regions; give each computing script an `--emit` mode. Wire the
bare run into the same "run before committing" list as the other gates. Start
with whichever document has already bitten you — the one someone had to be
reminded to update.

Two extensions the tool enforces once pairs exist. **The provenance footer:**
every registered document ends with a `**Numbers by:**` footer naming each
script that feeds it (the tool fails on a missing footer or an unnamed
script) — so a reader of the rendered page always knows which code produced
the numbers, without opening the sync tool's registry. **Composition:** an
emitting script may import other computing scripts and re-emit their numbers
in a new arrangement (a per-product sheet drawing on several models); the
sync gate then flags every downstream document when any upstream script
changes — the dependency graph rides the registry for free.

A third extension for documents that absorb concurrent merges. The sync
gate protects only the *generated* regions: a prose section can vanish in a
three-way merge and nothing turns red — and in one dependent repo the owner
asked whether a heavily-merged document had lost a major section (it had
not, but only a manual full-history scan of its section headers could prove
it). Where a document accumulates sections across concurrent branches, keep
a **required-sections list** beside the computing script's self-assertions —
a check that fails when a listed header is absent from the document. A
deliberate rename or removal updates the list in the same change; an
accidental merge-loss fails the build. The retroactive form of the same
check — every section header any commit ever added, compared against the
current document — answers "did we already lose something?" once, when the
suspicion first arises; the list encodes it forward.

## 20. Mistakes become rules: root-cause the miss, then encode the prevention

**Rule.** When a mistake is caught — by the owner, by an audit, or by a later
pass discovering an earlier session's error — fixing the instance is half the
job. Before the session ends, root-cause it *five-whys style*: ask why
iteratively, past the surface slip, until the answer is a **process
property** — a missing rule, a missing check, a judgment recorded at the
wrong granularity, a stale document trusted, a default that invites the
error — stopping at the level where a cheap guard exists. Then encode the
prevention at the strongest rung available: (a) an **audit or lint** if the
failure is mechanically checkable (practice 6 — conventions become audits);
(b) else a **written rule, dated, carrying its origin incident** (practices
5 and 16 — the incident is both the justification and the test case); (c) if
the lesson is generic, **export it** (practice 14). Discuss the choice with
the owner when it involves a judgment call — which rung, what scope, whether
the guard is worth its cost.

**Why.** Repos that only fix instances relive their mistakes with new
surface details; the systemic cause remains free to fire again. The
root-cause habit is what turned one dependent repo's worst misses into its
strongest machinery — every audit it runs exists because of one specific,
recorded incident, and the audit that would have caught the incident is the
test of whether the root cause was actually found. The origin incident in
the rule text is load-bearing twice over: it tells a future reader what the
rule is protecting against (so the rule can be re-judged when the world
changes), and it calibrates proportionality (a guard that would not have
caught its own origin incident is theater).

**Proportionality guard.** Not every slip earns a rule: the trigger is a
systemic cause (it would recur) or real cost (rework, a wrong external
statement, lost work). Prefer strengthening an existing rule or audit over
minting a new one — rule-bloat is itself a failure mode, and a silent rule
nobody agreed to is how it starts.

**Install.** A habit plus a review question. The habit: end any session in
which a mistake was caught with an explicit root-cause note and its
prevention, in the same change-set as the fix. The review question, for the
owner: "does this guard's rung (audit / dated rule / export) match the
failure's checkability?" Seed it retroactively: the next time an old mistake
class recurs, that is the origin incident for its rule.

## 21. The second-pass capture sweep: production work gets a separate capture review

**Rule.** After producing any substantial work-product — a document, a design,
an analysis, a decision — the same session does a deliberate second pass **as
a separate step, not part of the production flow**, re-reading its own
reasoning against a short checklist: (a) did every idea discussed reach its
**durable artifact**, or does it live only in prose or conversation? (b) do
**parallel artifacts** that must track this change have their transfer
verdicts (practice 22)? (c) did technical value get its **cross-ledger
capture** — the business, operational, or planning implication recorded where
those live? (d) are open decisions **queued in the typed TODO** (practice 2)
rather than only in the conversation? (e) are the **indexes, registries, and
glossaries** synced? Run the sweep before the merge-time capture gate
(practice 10), so what it finds lands in the same change-set as the work.

**Why.** The production mindset cannot audit itself: while drafting, every
idea feels captured because it was *thought*. In the origin repo, an
owner-prompted "did we miss capturing anything?" sweep found two real gaps in
the same day's work — a cross-artifact transfer that had been waved off and a
competitor-inspired idea noted in passing but never landed — each of which
the drafting passes had individually missed. The separation is the point: the
sweep is a different cognitive act (reading for omissions) from drafting
(writing for completeness), and it is cheap — minutes against the cost of a
lost idea.

**Install.** Add the checklist to the session-end or pre-merge ritual, before
the capture gate. Adapt the checklist items to the repo's ledgers (what
counts as a durable artifact, which registries exist). The trigger for
adopting it retroactively: the first time an owner's "did we miss anything?"
finds something — that incident is the origin story (practice 20).

## 22. Parallel-artifact families: transfer verdicts are per-mechanism, per-change, and ledgered

**Rule.** When a family of artifacts embodies **one design in several
parallel forms** — the same architecture on different platforms, media,
languages, or markets — a change to any member presumptively transfers to the
others, and the transfer check obeys three constraints. **Decompose by
mechanism, not headline:** the verdict is formed per mechanism inside the
change, never once for a whole cluster — a cluster's headline can be
member-specific while a mechanism inside it transfers. **Verdicts are
per-change, not per-session:** a verdict recorded for one batch of changes
says nothing about the next batch added later, even minutes later; re-run the
check every time. **Every verdict is ledgered:** a dated row per change —
originating matter, and per member either *applied as `<what>`* or *no
transfer because `<reason>`* — with a small **audit that fails any change
date lacking a complete row**.

**Why.** The origin incident: a session recorded a headline-level verdict
("this cluster is member-specific — no transfer") that was true as a headline
and wrong for one mechanism inside it, which transferred to all three sibling
artifacts. Nothing forced the verdict to be decomposed, re-run, or recorded
per member, so the miss was invisible until a prompted second pass (practice
21) caught it. Free-text one-time verdicts have three failure modes the
ledger kills: wrong granularity (headline vs mechanism), staleness (new
changes inherit old verdicts), and unauditability (nothing can check what was
never recorded).

**Install.** A ledger table (date | originating change | one verdict column
per family member) plus a small audit keyed on dated change markers in
whatever registry tracks the family — any marked date without a complete
ledger row fails. The family definition itself lives at the top of the
ledger, with the origin incident (practice 20).

## 23. Layered practice packs: a domain layer between generic and repo-local

**Rule.** Rules come in three scopes, and each gets its own home. **Generic**
rules (true of any repo) live in this upstream and its instantiations.
**Repo-local** rules (true only of one repo's subject matter) live in that
repo's instructions files and never leave. Between them sit **domain** rules —
true of any repo running the same *kind* of program (a compliance regime, a
lab workflow, a regulated-filing process) but meaningless outside it. Those
are collected into a **practice pack**: a vendored tree at `process/<pack>/`
with the same anatomy as this upstream (a practices catalog, an install
playbook, extracted tools, harness adapters), tracked by its own manifest at
`process/manifest_<pack>.json` with its own optional scrub blocklist, audited
by the same `practice_audit.py` (it discovers every `process/manifest*.json`).
A pack may **route**: its harness adapter (e.g. an agent skill) declares when
the domain's rules apply, so an agent loads them exactly when doing that
domain's work instead of carrying them in every session. The decision rule
for any new rule: *would this hold in an unrelated repo?* → upstream (public
scrub applies). *Only in another repo running the same kind of program?* →
the pack. *Only here?* → repo-local.

**Why.** A domain program inside a dependent repo accumulated rules that
were neither generic (they could not be published, and their vocabulary was
all domain) nor repo-local (a second program of the same kind would need
every one of them). With no home of their own they lived interleaved with the
repo's local rules, which meant every session carried them whether relevant
or not, and a future split of the program into its own repo would have meant
re-deriving which rules travel. Vendoring them as a pack made the split a
`git mv` instead of an archaeology project — the same pre-split shaping that
made this upstream's own extraction clean.

**Install.** Vendor the pack tree at `process/<pack>/`; write
`process/manifest_<pack>.json` (schema of [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) §5, plus
`upstream.scrub_blocklist` — a path, or `null` to opt a private pack out of
the scrub); instantiate the pack's practices in the repo's real files and
record the mapping; install its harness adapter so the rules load when the
domain work happens. The export gate (practice 14) covers packs too: a thread
that improves a domain practice folds the abstracted form into the pack tree
in the same branch, keeping repo vocabulary out per the pack's blocklist.

## 24. Quote discipline: compression rounds against the writer, and qualifiers travel

**Rule.** Two obligations whenever a document quotes a figure from another
source. **(a)** When a sourced range or multi-case figure is compressed for
prose — rounded, summarized to one number, or reduced to its typical case —
the compression **rounds against the writer's interest**, or quotes both
ends. A summary that must pick one number picks the one that makes its own
argument weakest. **(b)** A source's **qualifiers are part of the figure**:
*best-case*, *worst-case*, a scenario label, a verify flag, or a fidelity
grade worse than the house default all travel with the number into every
document that quotes it. Dropping the label is misquoting, even when the
digits are copied faithfully. **(c)** When the source in hand is itself a
**summary of a primary artifact** — a briefing, a digest, a recording's
recap, a colleague's paraphrase — read the primary before drawing a
*structural* conclusion from it. A summary preserves the facts its author
found interesting and silently drops the ones that carry the structure, so
the omission is invisible from inside the summary: nothing in it looks
missing.
Clause (c) has a separate origin. A working session was handed an accurate
summary of a technical disclosure and reached the right conclusions about
it — then, on pulling the primary documentation, found the single fact the
whole analysis turned on: the flaw the summary described as an oversight was
structurally *unavoidable* in the design it appeared in, which converted the
finding from "an instance of a known bug class" into "an antipattern with a
general remedy" and changed what the work recommended. The summary was not
wrong about anything it said. It simply had no reason to mention the fact
that mattered most, and no reading of it would have revealed the gap.

**Why.** An adversarial audit of an outward-facing summary found the same
failure four independent times in one document: every compression had
drifted in the flattering direction (a range's ceiling shaved down, margin
bands quoted above their source, an unfavorable finding described as
missing data, a favorable-case figure paired with an unfavorable-case
market). None was a deliberate misstatement — each was an ordinary
summarization choice made under the incentive every summary carries. A
separate pair of findings showed the qualifier failure: a schedule date its
source twice labeled *best-case* became the central case downstream, and a
source's own worse-than-default fidelity grade was silently overridden by
the quoting document's blanket precision claim. The bias is systematic, so
the countermeasure must be a standing rule, not vigilance.

**Corrections that arrive as a pair are adopted as a pair.** When verifying a
figure against sources turns up two corrections to the same item that pull in
opposite directions — a price lower than assumed *and* a service life shorter
than assumed, say — adopting only the half that flatters the position is
selective sourcing, the quote-discipline failure in a subtler coat. Take both
in the same edit and let the record state that they were adopted together and
what the net came to; a verification pass whose every accepted correction
happens to move one way should be re-read for the halves it declined.

## 25. Outward-facing summaries: a claims-to-source table, honest aggregation, and a recorded adversarial pass

**Rule.** A document that summarizes a body of work for an external audience
carries three things. **(a) A claims-to-source table**: every quantitative
claim mapped to the living source that backs it — this is what makes
verification cheap enough to actually run. **(b) Honest aggregation**: any
sum over rows drawn from different sources names its rows and states its
dedupe rule beside the sum, after reading each row's defining prose for
inclusion statements (rows with different names are not additive until
proven additive); and in any companion computation, a revenue or benefit
line names its enabling condition and the computation either carries that
enabler's cost or excludes the line. **(c) A recorded adversarial pass
before external use**: claim-vs-source verification plus a cross-document
consistency sweep, run adversarially (a subtly different range counts as a
finding), with findings, resolutions, and the open tail written to a dated
diligence record. The record is part of the deliverable.

**(d) Run the pass automatically, in the same working session, before
reporting the work done** — do not queue it, offer it as an option, or defer
it to "before external use". Deferred verification is verification that does
not happen: the session that wrote the analysis is the one that still holds
the reasoning, and a later session inherits the conclusions without the
context that would let it attack them. Only genuinely external blockers (an
unreachable source, a number needing a field measurement) stay open, listed
as the open tail rather than used to postpone the pass. **(e) A correction
that moves numbers in the author's own favour carries its justification in
writing** — that direction needs the most scrutiny, not the least. **(f) When
a model composes two agents with different characteristic times, check the
slower one's cycle time against the faster one's before costing the
composition** — a cost model can be dimensionally perfect and still describe
an operation that cannot be performed. **(g) When comparing alternatives,
check that each side's standing/availability cost is charged, or that
neither is** — marginal-only costing of a human alternative against a
capital alternative that already carries its overhead is the commonest
one-sided comparison, and it flatters whichever side the author owns.
**(h) State which technology generation the incumbent is allowed to use.**
Costing your automated proposal against a manual incumbent compares your
future to their present. Give the incumbent the same generation of technology
your own case assumes, and where you claim an asymmetry — that a rule or a
physical constraint permits your automation but not theirs — justify it from
the environment rather than from convenience, and say which regime each
finding belongs to. **(i) When a term's sign or direction is the claim being made,
compute it — do not reason about which way it goes.** Directional assertions
about a model's own terms are the easiest thing to get backwards and the
hardest to notice, because they sound like understanding.

**Why.** The same audit that produced practice 24 found twenty-two defects
in a summary whose every number had been written in good faith from real
sources: three differently-named rows summing one underlying market, a
benefit line booked without its gating cost, claims citing documents that
did not contain them, and stale values the sources had since revised. The
claims-to-source table let two independent reviewers verify thirty claims
in minutes — without it the pass would have been unaffordable and would not
have happened. The diligence record then made every fix auditable and left
an honest open-items tail the next revision inherits, converting a one-off
cleanup into a repeatable gate. Clauses (d)–(f) came later, from the
principal's standing direction after a second analysis shipped with its pass
queued rather than run ("I don't care about unchecked work"): the pass that
was then run immediately found that the model had silently assumed a
composite operation neither participant had time to perform — a defect no
amount of source-checking would have surfaced, because every input was
correct and only their *composition in time* was impossible. Clause (g) came
from the principal's next question — whether the human alternative's
availability cost had been modelled. It had not, while the authored side's
equivalent overhead was already charged; the omission was invisible because
each side's own numbers were internally consistent. Clause (h) followed
immediately: the same reviewer asked whether the manual incumbent should have
been allowed to automate too. It should — and modelling it removed most of the
proposal's advantage, leaving a narrower but defensible claim. The three
questions form a family: whether the composed parts fit in *time*, whether
both sides carry their *standing* costs, and whether both are costed at the
same *technology generation*. A fourth round added clause (i) after the
author's own answer to a reviewer's challenge asserted, confidently and
backwards, which way one of the model's terms inverted — inside the very pass
meant to be checking the work. The lesson generalises past cost models: a pass
that only re-reads reasoning reproduces its errors, while one that re-computes
the disputed quantity does not.

## 26. Documents are current state; the VCS is the revision history

**Rule.** A document reads as a statement of what is true *now*, not a log of
how it got there. Do not annotate in-document when text was added or changed —
no "*(added DATE)*" / "*(rewritten DATE)*" section tags, no "Rev N" ladders in
headers, no superseded text kept inline "for history." Version control carries
all of that losslessly; `log`/`blame` answers "when did this change" better
than a prose annotation ever will, and never goes stale. Narrow exemptions,
where the date or prior state *is* the content: (a) records whose subject is a
dated decision or event ("decided DATE: X"); (b) volatile-fact freshness
stamps (practice for dated external claims); (c) legally or contractually
load-bearing markers; (d) as-shipped/as-filed artifacts whose purpose is
historical.

**Why.** A working document set accreted so many added/rewritten/Rev-N
annotations that documents read as changelogs instead of positions — and the
annotations themselves went stale (a "Rev 3" reference outliving Rev 5, an
"added 2026-…" tag on text three rewrites old), becoming a second drift
surface on top of the content. The revision history was already in the VCS,
losslessly; the in-document copy was pure liability.

**Install.** State the convention in the project instructions with its
exemption list; when touching a document, strip stale revision annotations
from the parts you touch. A lint can flag `Rev \d`/`\*(added ` patterns
outside the exempted file classes.

## 27. A label must describe what follows

**Rule.** A heading or lead-in that names a form or length must match what it
actually introduces. Do not title something "in one line" / "one-pager" / "in
one paragraph" / "TL;DR" unless it literally is that. If a section runs to a
page, name it for its content, not for a brevity it doesn't have.

**Why.** "The thesis in one line" sat atop three paragraphs; "the business
model in one line each" atop multi-line bullets. The label over-promises,
and a reader who trusts it feels misled the moment they read on — the same
credibility leak as a numeric claim that doesn't match its source. It reads
as spin in a document whose whole job is to be trusted.

**Install.** A writing convention in the project instructions; catch it in
document review. The fix is almost always to rename the label to its content
("The thesis"), not to compress the content to the label.

## 28. Frame the deliverable from the audience's question, not from the material in hand

**Rule.** When you finish producing a body of work and then write the thing
that explains it — a pitch, a summary, a README, a recommendation — build it
around **the question the audience actually has**, and check explicitly that
you have not instead built it around **the material you just produced**. The
tell is that the deliverable's headline matches the shape of your recent work
rather than the shape of the reader's problem. If a one-sentence statement of
the audience's question does not appear near the top, you probably skipped
this.

**Why.** A thread had just produced a detailed body of work on one property of
a system, and wrote the outward-facing explanation around that property. It
was true, well-evidenced, and nearly useless to the reader, whose question was
a different one that the same machinery answered better. The correction came
from outside and reframed the whole document — including which limitation was
binding, which market to lead with, and which mechanism was the strongest thing
on offer. Nothing was wrong with the underlying work; the framing was wrong
because it inherited the author's recent path instead of the reader's need.

This is a specific failure of *sequence*, not of care: the more thoroughly you
have just worked something out, the more available it is when you sit down to
explain, and availability reads as importance. Effort spent on a component is
not evidence that the component is the headline.

**Install.** Before writing an outward-facing artifact, write the audience's
question down as a plain sentence — literally, in the draft — and confirm the
artifact answers *that*. Keep it in the finished document if it helps the
reader; delete it if not. In review, ask of the opening: *whose question is
this?* When a reframe does arrive, record what it changed — but record it in the
**dated review artifact, not in the deliverable**. A reader who saw the earlier
version deserves the diff and the failure mode should stay legible (practice 20
applied to framing rather than to defects), yet a "what this used to say" block
inside a living document is precisely the changelog that practice 26 forbids.
Put it where dated history belongs; leave the deliverable reading as current
state.

**Related.** Practice 26 (documents are current state) constrains *where* the
reframe record goes — the two practices collide if this one is read as
licensing a changelog inside the artifact, and the review record is the
resolution. Practice 25 (an adversarial pass on outward-facing work) will not
catch this on its own: a well-framed-for-the-wrong-question document survives
claim-to-source verification intact, because every claim in it is true. The
framing check has to be separate, and it has to happen before the verification
pass rather than after.

**The internal case: a specification organised by answers hides its own
requirements.** The same failure has a quieter form aimed inward. A
specification that opens with identity, then dimensions, then a catalogue of
capabilities is organised by *what we decided*, and a reader who wants to know
*what the thing must do* has to reverse-engineer the requirements out of the
answers. That is tiring, and it is why the owner of a system can find its own
specification unreadable without being able to say why.

What makes this worth a separate note is the failure it causes rather than the
discomfort it causes. **A catalogue is indexed by subsystem or by feature, and a
requirement that crosses every subsystem has nowhere to live** — so it either
appears nowhere, or appears as an implementation detail inside whichever
subsystem happened to mention it first. Those cross-cutting requirements are
usually the load-bearing ones: the shared interface every other choice depends
on, the worst-case condition that sizes the structure. They are also the
expensive ones to discover late.

**Install.** Give a specification a requirements section *first* — a numbered
list of what must be true, each entry pointing at the section that specifies
how. Write it by asking "what must be true?" rather than by summarising the
sections below it, because summarising reproduces the same index and therefore
the same blind spot. Two prompts flush out most of what a catalogue loses:
*which requirement belongs to no single subsystem?* and *which case actually
sizes this — is it the one we describe most, or the one we describe least?*

## 29. A variant re-derives what it inherits: limits it must respect, choices it need not keep

**Rule.** When you build a variant of an existing thing — a new configuration
of a component, a fork of a process, a second instance of a design aimed at a
different job — treat **every attribute you inherited from the base as
unexamined until you have re-derived it against the new job**. Inherited
attributes come in two kinds, and both fail silently:

- **Constraints the base states** — which the variant must respect, and which
  your new reasoning may not have noticed it was violating.
- **Choices the base made** — which the variant is free to change, and which
  you may be carrying only because they were already there.

**Why.** One piece of work made both mistakes about the same base, in opposite
directions, a day apart. First it computed a favourable property of a variant
and announced a capability from it, without reading the base's own stated
limits — which excluded that capability in plain language. Then it carried
forward one of the base's design *choices* without asking whether the change of
job had invalidated it; it had, and the inherited choice made the whole variant
unworkable at its intended duty cycle. The second miss was worse than the first
because the arithmetic built on it was internally correct: the numbers
described, in convincing detail, an operation that could not be performed.

The asymmetry is what makes this hard to catch. A constraint you violate tends
to produce an obviously wrong answer eventually. A choice you fail to re-open
produces a *plausible* answer that is merely answering the base's question
instead of yours — and the more carefully you work downstream of it, the more
solid it looks.

**Install.** When starting a variant, list what changed about the job — duty
cycle, duration, environment, load, audience, tempo — and walk the base's
attributes against that list, marking each *re-derived*, *inherited
deliberately*, or *not yet checked*. Nothing stays in the third state at
delivery. Two prompts do most of the work: *"what does the base say it cannot
do, and does my variant's reasoning quietly assume otherwise?"* and *"which of
the base's choices exist only because of a job my variant is not doing?"*

**Related.** Practice 20 (mistakes become rules) is how this one was derived —
and note that the second instance was folded into the *same* rule as the first
rather than minted as a new one, per that practice's proportionality guard: two
failures with one root cause get one widened guard, not two narrow ones.

## 30. Scripts assert their own properties, and the figures their source documents recite

**Rule.** A script that computes numbers other work depends on carries two
kinds of executable assertion, and an audit (`tools/model_audit.py`) runs them
with the repo's other gates:

- **`self_check()` — property assertions on its own outputs.** Not "is this
  value right" but "does this output satisfy the properties it must satisfy":
  an invariance, a monotonicity, a conservation, an ordering, a ratio held by
  construction. Returns a list of failure descriptions; empty means pass.
- **`ANCHORS` / `check_anchors()` — figures recited in an authoritative source
  document** that the script must reproduce. Each anchor names the document and
  section that recites it. Compare as **band overlap**, not equality, when
  either side is an estimate.

Two rules make the difference between this working and being theatre.
**Assert properties, not values** — a value comparison cannot catch a correct
input transformed by a wrong law. And **never refit an anchor to silence it**:
a failing anchor means a script and a document of record disagree, which is
always a human's decision, and the resolution runs in both directions.

Scope it. Instrument the scripts that **consume or re-derive a quantity another
script or an authoritative document owns** — that is where this failure class
lives. Scripts that own their own numbers end to end need nothing. Keep the
instrumented list explicit so the audit can warn when a listed script has no
assertions.

**Why.** The obvious diagnosis for a wrong computed number is a stale copy, and
the obvious fix is a shared constants module. In the incident that produced this
practice, both were wrong.

A script published results that were out by a third at one input and by more
than a factor of three at another; work sized from them would have been badly
undersized. The constant it started from was **correct, correctly labelled, and
identical in the two sibling scripts that also used it** — one of which even
stated the governing property in its own docstring. The script cited its source
correctly. A shared constants module would have handed it exactly the right
number and the defect would have survived untouched, because the defect was in
the **transformation applied after import**: a scaling law applied to a quantity
whose defining property is that it does not scale.

That property was written down — in two sibling scripts' docstrings, in the
owning script's printed output, and in the figures recited by the authoritative
document. It was prose everywhere and executable nowhere, and **prose does not
fail a build**.

The sharpest part is where the correct number actually lived. **The
authoritative document was right and the script was wrong.** The document
recited the correct figure for exactly the case the script got wrong — and the
sync gate of practice 19 faithfully published the script's number into the
derived document, because it guards *document agrees with script* and cannot
know the script is wrong. Every artifact was internally consistent; the only
disagreement in the repo was with the one document nothing compared against.

Generalise that: **the most carefully reasoned documents in a repository are
often the ones checked by nothing.** They are written slowly, by whoever
actually reasoned the thing through, and then they sit — while fast-moving
derived artifacts get all the tooling. Driving everything from the scripts is
the natural instinct and it is backwards here; it would have propagated the
error faster. The document was the more reliable artifact and the more neglected
one at the same time.

Two further returns showed up immediately on installing this. First, an anchor
failed in a script written **by the same session that had just been burned by
this exact class of error and was actively watching for it** — care did not
prevent the repeat, the executable check did, on its first run. Second, anchors
surface **unstated assumptions in the source documents**: one recited figure
turned out to hold only under a qualitative condition the document never
quantified, and the unconditional figure — the one anything must actually be
sized to — was materially different. Neither of those is findable by reading.

**Install.** Add `tools/model_audit.py`; list the scripts to instrument in its
`INSTRUMENTED`. In each, add `self_check()` returning failure strings, and
`ANCHORS` as `(label, lo, hi, callable -> (lo, hi))` with `check_anchors()`
comparing by overlap. Label every anchor with the document and section it comes
from. Wire the bare run into the same pre-commit list as the other gates.

Start where a quantity crosses a boundary: the first script that takes a number
it did not derive. Write the assertion as the sentence you would use to explain
the quantity to someone — *"these must be equal by construction"*, *"this can
only decrease"* — because that sentence is the property, and the property is
what a wrong transformation violates.

When an anchor fails, record which way it resolved. In the origin round of three
failures, one was the script's error, one an unstated assumption in the
document, and one a superseded input; all three were written down and none were
fitted away. That record is what keeps the mechanism honest — an anchor quietly
widened to pass is worse than no anchor, because it now certifies the thing it
stopped checking.

**A detector for a specific sub-class: solved outputs that repeat across
cases.** When a script solves a quantity per case — per configuration, per
variant, per row of a comparison — an identical value appearing across cases
with different inputs is a defect signal: a constant is hiding where a
per-case solution belongs. The origin instance was exactly this shape: one
variant family's supposedly-solved parameter was a single hand-copied number
across every case, and the number turned out to be a figure borrowed from an
*unrelated* constraint in a predecessor analysis — recognizable by value, wrong
in role — which a user caught by asking why cases with different inputs shared
an output. The check is mechanical and cheap: collect each solved output across
cases; a value shared by two cases with different inputs must be explained by a
**named shared constraint** the solver reports as its binding limit; an
unexplained repeat fails. This also catches the softer form, where a shared
*class default* (a duty factor, a lapse, a rating) silently reaches a case
whose class it does not fit — the same session found one of those the same day,
and the tell was again a column identical across rows that should have
differed.

**Related.** Practice 19 guards *document agrees with script*; this one guards
*script agrees with reality and with the document of record* — the edge one
level up, and the one that bites when the script is the wrong artifact.
Practice 6 (conventions become audits) is the general form. Practice 20
(mistakes become rules) produced it, including the correction of its own first
root-cause analysis, which named the stale-copy diagnosis above and had to be
retracted when a one-line check disproved it. Practice 29 (a variant re-derives
what it inherits) is the drafting-time counterpart of the repeat detector
above.

## 31. A tool's warning never justifies rewriting published history

**Rule.** When a hook, linter, badge, or CI check complains about commits that
are **already published** — on the shared trunk, or authored by someone else —
the response is to fix the setting **forward** and leave the history alone.
Configure the identity, the tool, or the exemption so future commits are clean;
do not rebase, amend, or force-push to satisfy the warning. Rewriting published
history is reserved for an explicit human instruction, never inferred from a
tool's output.

**Why.** These warnings are written as if every commit they see is yours and
still local, and the remedy they suggest — `rebase --exec ... --amend` — is
accurate for that case and catastrophic outside it. On a shared trunk it
rewrites commits other people authored and already built on, forces a divergent
default branch, and trades a cosmetic badge for a genuine coordination failure.
The asymmetry is total: the warning's cost is that something looks untidy, and
the suggested fix's cost is that everyone else's clone is now wrong.

The trap is that the tool is *correct about the condition* and merely silent
about the context. It is right that the commits lack the property; it does not
know they are published, does not know which are yours, and cannot weigh what
its remedy costs. An agent reading such output is being handed a confident,
specific, executable instruction with the reasoning omitted — the shape most
likely to be followed without the judgement the situation actually needs.

Generalise past the specific tool: any automated warning whose suggested remedy
is *destructive and retroactive* — rewriting history, mass-reformatting a
shared tree, regenerating a lockfile everyone pins, bulk-editing files a check
flags — gets the same treatment. Satisfy it forward, exempt what is already
published, and escalate to a human if the backlog genuinely matters. A warning
is a report, not an authorization.

**Install.** Set the identity or configuration the tool wants, so new work stops
triggering it. Where the tool supports it, scope the check to unpublished or
own-authored commits. Record the decision — including the count of pre-existing
items deliberately left alone — next to the merge or release runbook, so the
next person sees a resolved question rather than an unexplained backlog and
re-litigates it. If the tool has no scoping option and the noise is persistent,
that is a request to file against the tool, not a reason to act on it.

**Related.** Practice 20 (mistakes become rules) — this is the abstracted form
of a rule a dependent repo added after a session was one command away from
rewriting a shared trunk to clear a signature badge on commits it did not own.

## 32. Verify the postcondition, not the command

**Rule.** After any state-changing operation, check **the state you wanted**,
not that the command reported success. Name the postcondition before you run
the command — *"no unpushed commits on any branch"*, *"the gate passed"*,
*"the file contains X"* — and then test that, independently of whatever the
command printed.

Two traps deserve naming because they produce confident, wrong success
messages:

- **A pipeline's exit status is its last command's.** `check | tail && publish`
  does not gate on `check`. The gate can print FAIL in plain sight and the
  publish still proceeds. Run gates bare and test `$?`; if you pipe for
  readability, capture the status first or use the shell's pipe-status
  facility.
- **A command with an explicit target acts on the target you named, not the
  context you are in.** Publishing by naming a branch publishes *that* branch,
  whether or not it is the one you have been working on. If it has not moved,
  the operation succeeds as a no-op and says so.

**Why.** Two incidents in one session, one root cause. A gate chained through a
pipe let a failing check reach the shared trunk. Then work was committed on the
wrong branch and "published" by naming the intended branch explicitly — which
had not moved, so the push succeeded, reported success, and left the commit
sitting unpublished somewhere else. The session reported the work delivered.

Neither command malfunctioned. Both did exactly what they were literally asked
to do. The defect was reading *"the command ran"* as *"my intent was
achieved"* — and the more precisely a command is targeted, the more completely
it ignores your context, which is a virtue right up until your context is
wrong.

The second incident is the sharper one, because the misleading part was the
*success*. A failure would have been investigated. A green line about an
operation you did not intend gets skimmed, and the more automated the reporting,
the more likely it is skimmed. An agent narrating its own work is especially
exposed here: it produces the summary from the same premises that produced the
mistake, so the summary inherits the error and reads as confirmation.

Note what actually caught it: an **independent check** — a hook comparing local
branches against the remote — not the session's own review. Self-reported
completion cannot catch a wrong premise about what "complete" meant. That is
the argument for having such a check at all, and for treating its output as
information rather than noise.

**Install.** For each operation that matters, write the check next to the
action:

- **Gates:** run bare, test the exit status. Never gate on a pipeline.
- **Before committing:** confirm which branch you are on.
- **Before declaring anything delivered:** enumerate every local branch against
  its remote and require the difference to be empty — the postcondition is
  "nothing unpublished anywhere", not "the publish command printed something".
- **In general:** if you cannot state the postcondition, you do not yet know
  what the command was for.

Cheap and worth it: end a work session by re-deriving the finished state from
the repository rather than from your own transcript.

**Related.** Practice 6 (conventions become audits) — this is the audit for
"did the thing actually land". Practice 20 (mistakes become rules) produced it,
from two failures with one root cause folded into one widened rule rather than
two narrow ones, per that practice's proportionality guard.

## 33. Documents track their models, and every transformation lives in code

**Rule.** Extending practice 19 from *tables* to **every** figure a script
computes:

1. **A script-derived figure appears in a document only inside a generated
   block.** Including figures embedded in running prose — those are the ones
   the sync gate cannot see, and therefore the ones that rot.
2. **Never restate a generated number in the prose around its block.** Point at
   the table instead. A restatement is a second copy with no gate on it. If a
   figure genuinely must appear in a sentence, put the sentence inside the
   block.
3. **Every transformation belongs in the emitter.** Unit conversions, rounding,
   banding, audience-facing phrasing, redaction for external copies — all code.
   A number converted by hand is a number nobody can regenerate, and a rounding
   applied by hand is a rounding nobody can audit.

When a script changes, every dependent document changes with it, in the same
commit, by regeneration rather than by editing.

**Why.** A sync gate only guards what it can see. In the incident that produced
this, a defective script published wrong figures into several documents; the
generated tables were corrected automatically the moment the script was fixed,
and the **hand-written prose statements in the same documents stayed wrong** —
found later only by a deliberate contamination sweep. The gate had worked
perfectly on everything it was pointed at, which is precisely why the gaps were
invisible.

Hand-applied transformations hide the same way. A metric figure typed again in
feet is two numbers that must be maintained together and will not be; a range
"rounded for prose" is an editorial decision with no record of which direction
it moved. Both look like writing and behave like un-versioned code.

The scope limit matters: **this applies to documents not yet issued.** An
artifact already sent to someone is a record of what they received and must not
be silently regenerated — fix the source, mint a fresh copy, and let the
distribution record show both.

**Enforced, not merely stated.** Rule 2 is mechanically checkable and now is:
a script declares the figures it owns via `owned_figures()`, returning them in
the **exact rendered forms it produces** — value and unit, formatted as the
emitter formats them — and the sync tool greps every document *wired to that
script* for those strings outside its generated blocks. Three scoping choices
keep it usable rather than noisy: only wired documents are scanned, only
declared figures are searched, and matching requires a **unit boundary** so
`30 m` never matches `30 m/s`. That last one is not hypothetical — it was the
first thing the check got wrong, firing on two speeds on its first run, and it
is the reason a naive scan for "numbers a script produced" is worthless. A
deliberate restatement is marked `<!--owned-ok-->` on the line. Scripts that
declare nothing are not checked; instrumentation is opt-in, per script.

**Install.** When wiring a document: wrap every script-derived figure, give the
emitter an audience-appropriate form (the same numbers may want a different
table for an internal reader and an external one — that is two emitters, not
two hand-edits), and put the provenance footer at the foot of the document so a
reader knows which code produced what. Then **sweep the prose** for figures the
scripts own and either wrap them or replace them with a pointer; a short regex
sweep over the owned quantities finds these quickly and is worth re-running
whenever a script's outputs change shape.

A companion audit closes the loop the other way: **the registry that wires
documents to scripts is itself verified** (an unregistered generated block is
one nothing checks, and its numbers rot silently while every gate reports
green), and a document may **opt in** — placing a marker alone on a line — to a
stricter rule that *every* quantity in it be generated, cited to an external
source, or explicitly marked an estimate. Measure before making that a
repo-wide gate: in the origin repo ~91% of quantity tokens were unexplained, so
the strict rule is per-document opt-in, and a report mode sizes the backlog
without blocking anything. Two false-positive traps are worth inheriting: match
declared figures with a **unit boundary** (else "30 m" matches "30 m/s"), and
require the opt-in marker to be **alone on its line** (else a document that
merely mentions the marker opts itself in and fails on its own examples).

Where a document needs figures from several scripts, let the emitter **import**
the other scripts rather than restating their numbers, so each figure keeps
exactly one owner (practice 19's composition extension, and practice 30's
one-owner rule applied to documents).

**Related.** Practice 19 (generated blocks) is the mechanism; this is its
scope. Practice 30 (scripts assert their properties and their sources' figures)
guards the layer below — that the script is right before its numbers are
published everywhere automatically.

## 34. Outward-facing documents use the reader's vocabulary, not the sources'

**Rule.** A document written for an audience outside the work — a README, a
product page, a pitch, an onboarding guide — uses words the intended reader
already owns. Every term that names a category gets one of three verdicts:
it is **already the reader's word**, so keep it; it has a **plain
equivalent**, so use that instead; or it is **genuinely the right term**, so
gloss it inline on first use — a short parenthetical, in the sentence, not a
pointer to a glossary. The test that catches most cases: *if the term can be
replaced by a plain description of five words or fewer, it is jargon.*

**Why.** Jargon in an outward-facing document usually arrives from the
**sources**, not from the author — and that is what makes it systematic
rather than careless.

The origin incident: a product description aimed at people who work in
Google Docs and Notion used *forge* throughout — the self-hosted-git
community's word for a repository hosting platform — alongside *substrate*,
*lens*, and *stateless*. The owner's reaction was the diagnosis: "I have no
idea what it means or where it came from." It came from the research done
for the document days earlier. It had never been the author's word, and it
was certainly not the reader's.

Two properties generalise from that:

- **The risk scales with how much research went into the document.** The
  more sources you read, the more of their register you carry, and their
  words feel natural precisely because you have just spent hours inside
  them. The documents most likely to fail this are the well-researched ones.
- **Recently acquired words are indistinguishable from long-held ones.** You
  cannot feel which words you learned this week. An agent is maximally
  exposed: it acquires a source's vocabulary within a single session, has no
  sense of when a word entered its usage, and writes fluently in whatever
  register it just read.

Note that a glossary is the **wrong remedy here**, which is what separates
this from practice 17. You can ask a colleague to consult the repo's
glossary. You cannot ask a prospective user to consult anything — they will
simply stop reading.

**Install.** A vocabulary pass, run as a **separate step after drafting**,
in the shape of practice 21's capture sweep: write the intended reader down
as a plain sentence, then walk every category-naming noun against *"would
this reader define this unprompted?"* Where the answer is no, apply one of
the three verdicts. Do it after the framing check of practice 28, since
reframing changes who the reader is.

The natural audit extension (practice 6) is a per-repo list of known insider
terms, checked by [tools/doc_lint.py](tools/doc_lint.py) against documents
marked outward-facing — the same machinery as the scrub blocklist of
practice 15, aimed at comprehension instead of confidentiality. Keep it
**warning-level**: a glossed term is a legitimate pass, and only a human can
judge that.

**Related.** Practice 17 (acronyms and a central glossary) is the
inward-facing counterpart — expansion for readers who will consult a list.
Practice 27 (a label describes what follows) and practice 28 (frame from the
audience's question) are the other two audience-facing failures, and all
three survive each other: a document can be correctly framed, honestly
labelled, and still unreadable because of its vocabulary. Three separate
passes, not one.

## 35. Build/buy: decompose before deciding, and keep the verdict supplier-independent

**Rule.** A build-or-buy question almost always arrives at the wrong
granularity — *"should we build this ourselves or get it from them?"* — and
answering it as posed produces a yes/no about a supplier when what was needed
was a map. Two moves, in order.

**First, decompose the thing being procured, and give each part its own
verdict.** The parts usually disagree, and the disagreement is the answer. The
diagnostic is blunt: **if your answer is a single yes/no, you probably have not
checked whether the thing has parts with different answers.** In the origin
case a four-way split turned "wrong supplier" into "right supplier, wrong
layer" — which is a usable answer, where a flat no would have closed a door
worth keeping open.

**Second, rest the verdict on ownership arguments rather than capability
arguments, then check that it survives being wrong about the supplier.**
The distinction is what makes a decision durable:

- **Ownership arguments** — what recurring cost the choice imposes per unit
  shipped, what compounding asset it starves, what it does to the thing your
  strategy names as your advantage — hold no matter how good the supplier turns
  out to be.
- **Capability arguments** — *"they can't do this part"* — invert the moment the
  supplier improves, or the moment your read of them proves wrong. And your read
  is usually a desk read of their own marketing: in the origin case the
  supplier's product documentation was literally unreachable from the working
  environment, so the capability picture came entirely from press releases.

Label each argument as one or the other while writing. A recommendation built
on capability has a shelf life measured in the supplier's release cadence.

**Why.** The failure this prevents is not choosing wrongly between two known
options — it is answering a question whose premise (that the thing is one
thing) was never checked, and then defending the answer with the most available
evidence, which is whatever the supplier says about themselves.

**Install.** Write the decomposition as a table with one verdict per part
before writing any prose. State, next to each argument, whether it is about
ownership or capability. Then name the **revisit triggers** that would reverse
the decision, and make the cheapest one *a question to ask* rather than an
assumption to hold — a decision resting on an unpriced assumption about someone
else's pricing is one conversation away from being confirmed or overturned, and
leaving that conversation unhad is a choice, not a limitation.

**Related.** Practice 28 (frame from the audience's question) is the adjacent
move at the artifact level; this one operates on the decision itself, and the
two compose — the audience's question is often posed at the wrong granularity
too. Practice 25's adversarial pass will confirm every claim in a
wrongly-decomposed analysis, so the decomposition has to be challenged
separately.

## 36. Section order follows the reader's frequency, not the writer's derivation order

**Rule.** In any document that walks through instructions, guidance, or rules
in multiple sections, order the sections by how often and how urgently the
reader will actually need them — common, everyday content first; rare edge
cases, migration scenarios, and "if the world changes" contingencies last —
unless the subject matter itself dictates a different order (steps that must
be followed in sequence, a narrative that only makes sense in one direction).
The test: would most readers have to scroll past this section to reach the
one they actually opened the document for?

**Why.** A document is drafted in the order its author thought it through,
which is rarely the order its reader needs it in. An edge case sits next to
the common case that motivated it, in the author's head, and that adjacency
survives into the draft even though almost no reader will ever hit the edge
case — they just have to read past it every time.

**Install.** A writing convention, checked in review with the question
above; part of [templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template)'s
Conventions section. No mechanical audit — "which order serves most readers"
is a judgment call, not a pattern a lint can reliably detect.

## 37. GitHub-specific setup is disclosed where the reader will actually see it

**Rule.** Whenever an install step adds something GitHub-specific that a
project's own people need to know about — a required Actions workflow, a
repository secret, a branch-protection or required-check setting, a
permission grant — the fact, and the exact detail needed to act on it (what
it's called, what it does, any manual click to enable it), is written into
the document that project's own people actually read, not left only inside
BestPractice's internal install playbook. For a dependent repo, that
document is [templates/GETTING_STARTED.md](templates/GETTING_STARTED.md)'s
administrator section — [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) records the installation
mechanics; GETTING_STARTED.md records the consequence for this project's
administrator.

**Why.** An install can turn on a GitHub Actions workflow and record that
fact faithfully in this repo's own technical install log — a document a
project's administrator has no ordinary reason to reopen. Nothing points
them at it from the page they'll actually return to, so a check that needs
one click to enable can sit off, silently, until someone happens to look at
the Actions tab.

**Install.** [templates/GETTING_STARTED.md](templates/GETTING_STARTED.md)'s
administrator section carries a standing note for "automatic checks
installed for this project," naming each workflow and what it does. Any
future GitHub-specific addition — a required secret, a new required check —
gets a line there too, added by whichever install step introduces it.

## 38. A project's own document leads with what the project is

**Rule.** An outward document that both describes a project and explains how
it's maintained — a README, an entry page — states what the project actually
is and does, in the project's own subject matter, before it says anything
about the maintenance or editing process layered on top of it. A reader
arriving cold learns *what this is* before *how to work with it*.

**Why.** A newly created project's README once opened with a sentence about
how the project's memory lives in its repository and is edited by talking to
an AI assistant — true of the process layer, and the very first thing a
brand-new reader hit, before a single sentence told them what the project
itself was. "Wait, is this an AI assistant?" is the natural, correct reaction
to reading process-description with zero subject-matter context first.

**Install.** [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)'s README-entry step and
[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)'s guided install both instruct: if the repo has no
README yet, write a short project-specific opening — from the
administrator's "what is this project about" answer — before inserting the
[README_AGENT_ENTRY.md.template](templates/README_AGENT_ENTRY.md.template)
block. If a README already exists, insert only the entry block into it;
don't rewrite its opening.

## 39. A default PR template captures the living-doc gates — honestly, not mechanically

**Rule.** Every dependent repo installs a default pull-request template
covering what changed, why, files touched, and the practices' own
living-document gates (scrub, MAP, TODO, GLOSSARY) as a checklist. The body
is written from the actual diff; a gate is checked only when it is actually
true for this change. An unchecked box, or a "not applicable" note, is a
normal and expected outcome — never a defect to paper over.

**Why.** A template with a fixed checklist is worth nothing the moment
filling it in becomes reflex: "N/A" typed into every box looks exactly like
verification happened and means nothing did. The template earns its place
only paired with an explicit instruction that unchecked boxes are fine — the
alternative trains exactly the behavior the checklist exists to catch.

**Install.**
[templates/pull_request_template.md.template](templates/pull_request_template.md.template)
→ `.github/pull_request_template.md` — installed the same way as `AGENTS.md`
(§1), propagated to existing installs the same way (§2). The "write from the
diff, unchecked is fine" instruction lives in
[templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template) so every
session opening a PR sees it, not just the template itself.
es a source's vocabulary within a single session, has no
  sense of when a word entered its usage, and writes fluently in whatever
  register it just read.

Note that a glossary is the **wrong remedy here**, which is what separates
this from practice 17. You can ask a colleague to consult the repo's
glossary. You cannot ask a prospective user to consult anything — they will
simply stop reading.

**Install.** A vocabulary pass, run as a **separate step after drafting**,
in the shape of practice 21's capture sweep: write the intended reader down
as a plain sentence, then walk every category-naming noun against *"would
this reader define this unprompted?"* Where the answer is no, apply one of
the three verdicts. Do it after the framing check of practice 28, since
reframing changes who the reader is.

The natural audit extension (practice 6) is a per-repo list of known insider
terms, checked by [tools/doc_lint.py](tools/doc_lint.py) against documents
marked outward-facing — the same machinery as the scrub blocklist of
practice 15, aimed at comprehension instead of confidentiality. Keep it
**warning-level**: a glossed term is a legitimate pass, and only a human can
judge that.

**Related.** Practice 17 (acronyms and a central glossary) is the
inward-facing counterpart — expansion for readers who will consult a list.
Practice 27 (a label describes what follows) and practice 28 (frame from the
audience's question) are the other two audience-facing failures, and all
three survive each other: a document can be correctly framed, honestly
labelled, and still unreadable because of its vocabulary. Three separate
passes, not one.

## 40. An option you invented is not a baseline — check the source architecture first

**The practice.** Before costing or optimising a trade between two configurations,
verify that **both configurations actually exist in the source architecture**. It is
easy to invent a decomposition, forget that you invented it, and then spend real
effort optimising within your own fiction — producing a defensible-looking analysis
whose baseline never existed.

The tell is a trade study where one side is described in the source material and the
other is described only in your own notes. If you cannot cite the alternative to a
document you did not write, you are not comparing options; you are comparing the
system to your model of it.

**Why it evades the usual checks.** Every downstream number can be internally correct.
The arithmetic reconciles, the units balance, the assertions pass — because the error
is upstream of all of them, in the framing. An adversarial pass that verifies claims
against sources will not catch it either, since the invented option has no source to
contradict. Only going back to the primary architecture catches it.

**Three questions that catch it cheaply:**

1. **Can I cite the alternative?** Not "is it plausible" — *which document specifies
   it*. An option with no citation is a hypothesis wearing a baseline's clothes.
2. **Does the established practice already integrate what I am proposing to combine?**
   Integration is common in mature designs precisely because someone already did this
   trade. If the answer is yes, the separated form is the thing needing justification,
   not the combined one.
3. **Am I optimising a step that should not exist?** A cost or delay attached to
   moving between two things you separated is a strong signal you separated something
   that was whole.

**When the check fires, correct the framing before the numbers.** Restating the
conclusion while keeping the invented structure leaves the same error with better
arithmetic. Re-derive from the source architecture, then re-cost — the corrected
answer often inverts the original one rather than adjusting it.

**Related:** practice 29 (a variant re-derives what it inherits) is the sibling
failure — carrying forward a base's *choices* unexamined. This one is the inverse:
introducing a distinction the base never made.


## 41. Search by purpose as well as by mechanism, and index what you write

**The practice.** Before concluding that no prior work exists on a question,
search the repository twice: once in the vocabulary of the **mechanism** (how the
thing works) and once in the vocabulary of the **purpose** (why it was done). Then
make your own output findable under both.

**Why one search is not enough.** Prior work is usually filed under the author's
reason for doing it, not under the machinery it used. A search keyed on the
mechanism misses a document that describes the *same mechanism* under a different
mission, and vice versa. The two vocabularies rarely overlap in a single
document's prose, so each search returns a clean, plausible, complete-looking
result set with the other half absent.

**Why it evades the usual checks.** Nothing in the missing document's absence is
visible. An adversarial pass that verifies every claim against its source passes,
because each claim really is supported; a consistency check across the documents
you *did* find passes, because they really are consistent. The failure is not a
wrong claim but an unexamined duplication — you re-derive a number someone
already owns, and if your value differs, the contradiction lands silently in the
repository for a later reader to trip over.

**The tell** is an "open item" that seems too basic to be open: a quantity so
central to the question that someone would surely have needed it already. When a
result says *"this wants a measurement we do not have"*, ask who else would have
needed the same measurement, and search for **their** reason for needing it.

**The other half is your own output.** Everything above applies to the next
reader looking for what you just wrote. So:

1. **Name the purpose in the document**, not only the mechanism — including the
   uses you are not writing about, so a search for those lands here.
2. **Link the document from an index** a reader actually consults. An analysis
   reachable only by knowing its filename is one nobody will find.
3. **Link the prior work you found**, in both directions. The path between two
   documents is the artifact with the shortest half-life; it is also the cheapest
   thing to add while both are open in front of you.

**Prefer a mechanical guard over a resolution to search harder.** "Search both
vocabularies" is advice a hurried reader will skip. "A document carrying
generated numbers must be linked from an index, checked by the linter" is a rule
that holds while nobody is paying attention — it does not force the *right*
search, but it guarantees the target of that search exists somewhere findable.
Measure the backlog when you introduce the check; a non-trivial count is the
evidence that the failure was systemic rather than one person's bad day.

**Related:** practice 25 (read the primary, not the summary) is the sibling
failure in the *depth* direction — this one is in the *breadth* direction.

## 42. Verify the decomposition, not the total — and never encode an impossibility

**The practice.** A model earns trust through how it is built, not through whether
its answer looks reasonable. Two failure modes exploit the gap, and both are
invisible to the checks people usually run.

**(a) A plausible total can hide errors that cancel.** If one term is omitted and
another is over-counted, the sum can land in exactly the range you expected, and
every downstream figure will look sane. Re-running the model does not help: it
reproduces its own assumptions faithfully, including the wrong ones. Nor does
tightening the tolerance on the output — the output was never the problem.

The tell is a headline number that survived several passes without anyone
re-deriving the *parts*. Ask what each term physically pays for, and whether
anything is charged twice or not at all: a shared budget spent by two consumers,
work computed over the wrong path length, an actor whose own cost was never
booked because the analysis was framed around the other actor.

**Two things fix it, and only the second is reliable:**

1. **Assert on the decomposition.** Write checks that each term is *present* and
   behaves correctly — this quantity must be non-zero whenever those two differ,
   that path must exceed this one, this cost must be zero below a threshold and
   rise past it. Checks on the total pass happily while the parts are wrong.
2. **Derive it a second time, independently, and keep that derivation.** Hand
   arithmetic where a closed form exists; a separately written integration where
   it does not. Cancelling errors are exactly the class that only a second,
   differently-structured derivation catches. Commit it as a harness rather than
   discarding it — the errors it catches recur, and a review that lives in
   someone's scratch directory protects nothing.

**(b) A negative result is often a parameterisation, not a property.** A model
answers the question its constants encode. If the levers that would relieve a
constraint are hard-wired to baseline values, the model can only ever report the
blocked case — and prose then promotes one parameterisation into a law of
nature. *"X is impossible"* becomes the finding when the truth was *"X is
impossible with these particular settings."*

The tell is a negative conclusion stated without a sensitivity beside it. Before
writing that something cannot be done, vary the inputs that would relieve it and
report the boundary instead: the conclusion is nearly always *"blocked here,
available there,"* which is far more useful than a flat no.

**Never encode an impossibility as an assertion until you have done that.** A
check that asserts a negative locks the error in as an invariant and defends it
against the next person who suspects otherwise — converting a soft mistake into
a hard one, and putting the burden of proof on whoever is right.

**Related:** practice 40 (an option you invented is not a baseline) is the same
family one level up — there the *framing* is unexamined rather than the terms.

## 43. An affordance you build for yourself is an affordance you hand to everyone

**The practice.** When you add a mechanism so that *your* system can do something
— find a thing, reach a thing, identify a thing — write down who else that
mechanism now serves, before you call the design done. The question is not
"could this be abused" in the abstract; it is the concrete one: **the capability
I just built is available to whoever else shows up, so who shows up?**

**Why it needs a rule.** The mechanism is added under a benign framing —
*"it needs to report where it is, so we can come back for it"* — and inside that
framing nothing looks wrong. The design review then checks whether the mechanism
works, which it does. Nobody is prompted to ask what the mechanism does for a
party who was not in the room, because the requirement that motivated it never
mentioned one. So the gap is not carelessness; it is that the framing of the
requirement is also the framing of the review.

**The tell:** a mechanism whose whole job is to *make something discoverable*, or
*reachable*, or *distinguishable*, where the thing is left alone, is valuable,
and the discovery channel is open to anyone. Locators, published identifiers,
default-on telemetry, convenience access paths, health endpoints, indexes built
so *you* can find your own assets — all of them work exactly as well for someone
else.

**What to do instead — three moves, in order of how much they usually buy:**

1. **Invert the default from announce to answer.** The strongest fix is usually
   not to protect the broadcast but to *stop broadcasting*: have the thing stay
   quiet and respond only to a request that proves who is asking. This changes
   the exposure from *proportional to time* to *proportional to authorized
   demand*, which is a different order of problem, and it is frequently cheaper
   than the thing it replaces.
2. **Split channels by who they serve, not by convenience.** One channel doing
   two jobs leaks the audience of the first to the audience of the second.
   Separate the local, operational path from the wide-area, custodial one, and
   each stops advertising the other's business.
3. **Make the exposed state a setting, not a property.** Where the exposure is
   genuinely required *sometimes* — a safety obligation, an interoperability
   requirement, a regulator's rule — do not resolve the conflict once at design
   time. Make it a state chosen per deployment by whoever knows the local
   conditions, and revocable afterwards, because the thing itself is usually in
   no position to judge.

**Two things worth checking while you are there.** First, **name the threat set
rather than saying "secure"** — the honest claim is almost always tiered
("undiscoverable by anyone with a commodity receiver; not by a well-equipped
state"), and a single unqualified word is the tell that nobody enumerated. Say
which tier you mean to each audience, and do not carry the generous phrasing into
the room where the demanding one applies. Second, **run the cost arithmetic
before assuming the safe option is the expensive one.** The intuition that
discretion is a premium feature is often simply false — and if it is false in
your system, that is a strong argument for making the discreet posture the
default rather than the upsell.

**Related:** practice 42(b) — compute the term whose direction is the point,
rather than reasoning about which way it goes; here the term is the cost of the
cautious option, and the reasoning was backwards.

## 44. Two named check levels: a fast one for every commit, a full one before merge

**Rule.** A repo of any size ends up wanting two different things when it
says "check this": a fast, cheap sanity pass a session runs constantly
without thinking about it, and a slower, complete audit that gates a merge.
Give the two levels fixed, distinct names in the repo's own
[GLOSSARY.md](templates/GLOSSARY.md.template) — a plain pair like *light
check* and *deep check* reads well, but any repo-chosen pair is fine — so a
person or a session can ask for one or the other unambiguously ("run the
light check before you commit that" vs. "this needs a deep check before we
merge") instead of re-describing what "check" means every time.

**Why.** Without named levels, "run the checks" is ambiguous between two
very different costs, and the drift goes one of two ways: sessions run the
expensive audit so often that it gets skipped when time is short, or they
run only the cheap pass and the expensive one quietly stops happening
before merges. Naming the two levels separately keeps both cadences
legible: the fast one stays cheap enough to run on every commit path with
no friction, the full one stays a deliberate, named gate that is obviously
missing if it's skipped.

**Install.** This repo's own [tools/doc_lint.py](tools/doc_lint.py) is
already the fast pass — it scans only the markdown a session touched — and
[tools/practice_audit.py](tools/practice_audit.py) is already the full one
— the public-safe scrub, baseline-hash checks, and everything else that
needs the whole repo. Naming them is the only step this practice adds: pick
the repo's own pair of names, add both to `GLOSSARY.md` with what each one
actually runs, and reference the names (not just the script paths) in the
merge runbook (practice 9) and in any CI wiring (practice 6). A repo that
adds its own extra fast checks (secret-shaped strings, conflict markers,
JSON/YAML syntax) folds them into the "light" name rather than inventing a
third level — two named levels is the right number for almost every repo.

## 45. A standing merge-authorization keyword

**Rule.** A repo can adopt one short, fixed word or phrase that, said as
its own final sentence in an otherwise-ordinary message, means "commit and
merge what we just agreed on, using this repo's usual conventions, without
asking again." Document the exact word, and the exact rule for what counts
as "standing alone" (its own line, or set off by a preceding
sentence-ending punctuation mark; case-insensitive), in the repo's
`GLOSSARY.md` next to the other terms that mean something specific here.
Treat an ambiguous case — the word appears, but as part of a longer
sentence, or its standalone status is genuinely unclear — as *not*
authorization: ask, rather than assume.

**Why.** "Merge only when the user says so" (practice 9's authorization
default) is the right default, but typed out in full every time it's
invoked, it adds friction to the single most common approval a working
session asks for. A one-word standing trigger removes that friction
without weakening the default: it is still the human choosing, in the
moment, to say the word: the rule only fixes what a specific short
utterance is understood to authorize, so an agent never has to guess
whether "sounds good" or "yes" meant "and merge it" too. The strict
standalone-sentence test is what keeps the keyword from misfiring inside
ordinary language that happens to contain the same word for an unrelated
reason.

**Install.** Pick a word (or short phrase) that reads naturally as a
one-word reply and isn't likely to appear as ordinary language at the end
of an unrelated sentence — "go" or "merge" are typical choices. Add it to
`GLOSSARY.md` with the standalone-sentence rule spelled out, and cross-link
it from the merge runbook (practice 9) and from the "administrator
requests" section of `AGENTS.md`, so a session encountering the word for
the first time in a thread already knows where the rule lives instead of
inferring it from context.

## 46. Tabular documents ship a sortable render from one shared renderer

**Rule.** When a document's tables have multiple columns a reader might want
to sort — a trade study, a parameter sweep, a comparison matrix — the
markdown alone is not the finished product. Ship an HTML render delivering
the behavior contract below. The source document remains the source of
record (with its generated tables kept live by the doc↔model sync of
practice 33); the render is a committed build product, rebuilt after any
edit.

**The behavior contract.** This is what the reference implementation
([tools/doc_html.py](tools/doc_html.py)) delivers on every table, and what
any reimplementation on another stack must match — it is the spec a reader
of this practice is entitled to assume when a repo says "practice 46
render":

1. **Multi-column sort** — click a header to sort; shift-click (or a
   Multi-sort toggle) adds secondary keys; clicking a key again reverses
   it; marks on the headers show direction and key order.
2. **Numeric-aware sort keys** — cells sort numerically through the
   notation documents actually use: approximation marks (≈/≤/≥), any
   Unicode currency symbol, thousands separators, leading zeros, bare
   decimals, magnitude suffixes (k, M — recognized on currency amounts
   only, since a bare "M" is usually a unit), trailing units; empty and
   em-dash cells sort last. The same key drives the frontier axis
   pull-down (item 8), so a column ranks exactly as it sorts.
3. **A filter dropdown on every column** — no column is left without
   one. The panel offers what the column supports: a multi-select
   checkbox list of distinct values where the set is usefully small
   (2–60; any checked subset keeps its rows, none checked = "All", the
   default), plus on **value columns** a comparator — pick </≤/=/≥/>
   and type a threshold in the displayed units (cells that don't parse
   never pass) — and on text columns too varied to enumerate a
   contains match. A column's constraints AND together, the button
   shows the active selection, and filters compose with each other and
   with sorts. Multi-select is the point — comparing two named
   alternatives side by side is the most common filtering ask a
   comparison table gets; the comparator serves the "under $X /
   over Y t" ask value columns get. A value column is one whose cells
   *lead* with a number (the practice-46 item-12 test): "Rotax 916"
   contains a digit but is a name. On a text column that is a frontier
   ordinal axis (item 8), the dropdown's value rows list in the axis's
   current best→worst order and each carries a ⠿ grip that drags the
   row to re-rank — the same order the frontier picker edits, editable
   from whichever panel the reader has open; the checkbox still
   filters, only the grip drags.
4. **Active columns pin in place and stay visible** — sorted and filtered
   columns stick at the viewport's left edge as the table scrolls past
   them, without being moved from their positions; the header row stays on
   screen under vertical scroll. The reader's working columns never leave
   the viewport, and nothing rearranges itself. (Revised from an
   automatic move-to-left-edge behavior, which field use found confusing —
   the table reorganizing on every sort click; movement is the reader's
   act, not a side effect.)
5. **Draggable column order** — drag a header to move a column; dragging
   is the only way columns move. Implement every drag (this and the
   ordinal value lists of item 8) with **pointer events, never native
   HTML5 drag-and-drop**: hosted artifact viewers run renders in
   sandboxed frames where native DnD never fires (verified 2026-08-28),
   and pointer events also work on touch. Two traps: put the
   move/up listeners on the **document**, and do **not** pointer-capture
   the dragged element — re-inserting it in the DOM (the reorder itself)
   implicitly releases capture and kills the drag after its first swap.
   Gate the header drag behind a small movement threshold so plain
   clicks still sort.
6. **One Reset** — clears sorts AND filters and restores the original row
   and column order.
7. **Live row count** — "N of M rows" tracks filtering.
7b. **Alternate-value views (optional)** — a cell may carry one
   `<span data-view="NAME">` per view of the same quantity (e.g. two
   pricing bases); the first view named is the default, and each
   further view gets a checkbox that swaps every such cell at once,
   re-sorting on the visible values (filters clear, since their value
   sets changed). Sorting, filtering, and the row count always read
   the ACTIVE view's text, never the concatenation.
8. **Frontier axis pull-down** — where a Frontier column exists
   (practice 47), the render opens showing frontier rows only, and the
   control is an axis pull-down that works on any such table with no
   per-document wiring: the printed ✓/— marks (the model's own
   computation, per practice 47) are the default view; the picker
   offers **every** other column as an axis and recomputes the marks
   client-side on a custom pick. A numeric column takes a reader-set
   better-direction (↓/↑); a **text column ranks as an ordinal axis
   by its value list, which the reader drags into best→worst order**
   (default: the column's sorted order; each value row carries a ⠿
   grip icon marking the drag affordance) — only a text column with too
   many distinct values to order is listed as not rankable. An "All
   rows" entry clears the filter. A generating model may curate the
   picker with an invisible frontier spec beside its table — fixed
   directions for the columns it names, input tags (informational,
   still selectable), the default axes, a partition column judged
   separately (format in the renderer's docstring) — but the spec
   refines the pull-down, never gates it: unnamed columns are still
   offered.
9. **Header definitions round-trip** — a header links to its definition
   note and shows it as a mouse-over tooltip; the note's return link lands
   back on the exact header cell it defines, not merely the table's
   section.
10. **The render is the versioned product** — it carries its build
    timestamp in the page header; the source carries none (version control
    is the history).
11. **Page mechanics** — source-file includes are expanded; relative repo
    links are rewritten to the hosted view; wide tables scroll inside
    their own container rather than the page.
12. **Decimal-aligned numeric columns** — in a column whose cells lead
    with a number (approximation marks, ×, or a currency symbol may
    precede it), each cell is padded so the number's integer end — and
    hence its decimal point — sits at one x-position down the column.
    The prefix is pixel-measured (markup-safe), so bold text, links,
    and proportional-width symbols align exactly, and trailing
    annotations don't disturb the line-up; a bare decimal (".45") has
    an empty integer part, so its point lands on the same line as
    "0.45"'s. Columns whose digits appear only inside text (part
    codes, composite cells) are left alone.

**The load-bearing half is singularity.** All table behavior — CSS, JS, sort
semantics, numeric-aware sort keys — lives in **one** shared renderer with a
registry of the documents it renders ([tools/doc_html.py](tools/doc_html.py)
is the reference implementation). A functionality change is made there and
only there, and the no-argument invocation rebuilds every registered render,
so the change manifests in every table at once. The test for a new
capability follows: it must manifest on every registered render **from the
engine alone** — a host or per-document declaration may refine it, never
gate it, or the "change once, upgrade everywhere" property is silently lost
for every table that lacks the declaration. Per-document build scripts
may survive as documented entry points, but as thin wrappers importing the
shared `render()` — never as forks of the CSS/JS. The failure this kills is
the same one practice 33 kills for numbers: N copied renderers drift
independently, and the oldest copy is the one a reader eventually trusts.

**Singularity crosses the repo boundary.** In a dependent repo, the
vendored copy of the renderer **is** the implementation and the repo's own
file is a thin host shim supplying only its document registry — the general
engine/shim rule is practice 50; this renderer is its strongest case, since
a spec-only export of "multi-sort with pinning and filters" reimplemented
from prose differs in a hundred details.

**Why sortable matters enough to be a rule.** A wide cross-product table
(say, 4 loads × 3 price points × 9 altitudes) is written in one canonical
order, but every reader arrives with a different question — cheapest rows
first, group by one factor, find the regime boundary in another. Static
markdown forces the writer to guess one question and answer only it; a
sortable render answers all of them without another build. The cheap test:
if you catch yourself emitting the same table twice in different orders, the
document wanted this practice.

**Install.** One renderer module (markdown → styled HTML, tables enhanced by
a small dependency-free script), one registry entry per document, renders
committed next to their sources, a line in each source pointing readers at
the render. Numeric sort keys must survive the units and approximations your
documents actually use (currency suffixes, ≈/≤/≥, thousands separators) —
extend the key parser when a new format appears, in the shared module, once.

**Related.** Practice 33 (documents track their models; transformations live
in code) supplies the live tables this renders; practice 12 (conventions
harden into audits) suggests the natural follow-on check — a registered
document whose render is stale fails the gate.

## 47. A permutation table carries a frontier column

A configuration study whose table is the cross-product of its input axes
(engine × layout × variant × objective, load × price × altitude, …) produces
more rows than any reader will scan, and most of them are dominated — some
other row is at least as good on every output the reader ranks by. Three
rules:

1. **The optimization outputs are the reader's choice, so when they are
   ambiguous, ask** — before building, put the question to the owner: *which
   outputs should the best-of selection rank on?* A frontier computed on
   axes the author guessed answers the author's question, not the reader's.
   When the axes are obvious from the document's own framing (a cost study
   ranks on cost), proceed and name them.
2. **One full table, with a Frontier column — never a pruned table beside an
   appendix.** Every row appears once; a **Frontier** column marks whether
   the row is Pareto-non-dominated on the stated outputs (name them beside
   the table, state the count "N of M"). The discipline is in the word
   *dominated*: a — row must be beaten or matched on every stated axis by
   some ✓ row, never merely unfashionable — the marking is a computation the
   model performs and can assert, not an editorial choice. Two tables of the
   same rows are two copies that drift; one table with a computed column
   cannot.
3. **The render toggles — and lets the reader re-rank.** The sortable
   render (practice 46) opens showing frontier rows only and carries a
   control to show all rows — the reader gets the compressed view first
   and the full matrix one click later, from the same table. That
   control is the axis pull-down of practice 46 item 8: the reader
   picks which output columns form the frontier and the render
   recomputes the marks, because rule 1's real point is that the axes
   are the reader's choice — the stated defaults answer the document's
   framing, and the pull-down answers everyone else's. The printed
   column stays the model's computation on the stated default axes; a
   reader's custom pick is a view, recomputed from the displayed
   values, never silently written back into the source.

**Why this is a rule and not taste.** The full matrix invites the reader to
do the dominance analysis in their head, badly; the frontier column does it
once, correctly, in code. And a frontier computed by the model is
regenerated by the model — an editorially curated "interesting rows" table
silently rots as the numbers move (the drift practice 33 exists to kill, in
row-selection form).

**Related.** Practice 44 (sortable render) carries the toggle and the
per-column value filters; practice 33 keeps the table regenerating from the
model.

## 48. A document does not remember its past; the index does

Current-state documents (the no-revision-history rule) still need
*provenance* — a reader landing on a fresh document that replaced an older
one deserves to know the lineage, and the older document's readers deserve a
pointer forward. Neither note belongs in the documents themselves: the fresh
document opens clean (no "successor to…", no inherited framing debt), and
the superseded one is not edited into a museum label. **Provenance lives in
the repository index**: the index row for the new document names what it
succeeded, the row for the old one names what superseded it, and where the
evolution itself carries lessons worth keeping, they go in a dedicated
evolution-notes document the index points to. Commit messages carry the
rest.

**Why the index and not the document.** A document is read for its content;
an index is read for orientation — lineage is orientation. Provenance notes
inside documents also invert the current-state rule's economics: they start
accurate and decay (the successor gets its own successor; the note never
updates), whereas index rows are touched every time the map is maintained.

**Related.** The current-state rule (git is the history) this completes;
practice 41 (index what you write) supplies the index rows this rides on.

## 49. Deliverables look like their output; the record doc holds everything else

A reader-facing document is the finished product: it contains what its
audience needs and nothing about how it was made. Everything else — the
claims-to-source table, the verification log, decision provenance ("who
chose this and when"), retired-alternative lore, open verify-later items,
notes about the document itself — is real and worth keeping, and lives in a
**paired record document** (`*_record.md`, or the diligence record where one
exists), linked once from the deliverable's footer and from the index. Three
rules:

1. **If it is not intended to travel with the text, it goes in another
   document.** The test is the reader: would the audience the document is
   written for act on this line? Apparatus that exists for future verifiers
   and future maintainers is record-doc content by definition.
2. **A verify-later flag is a prompt, not a label: go verify now.** The
   inclination to write "[verify]" marks the exact moment verification is
   cheapest — the claim and its context are in hand. Only an externally
   blocked item (an unreachable primary source, a needed field measurement)
   may remain open, listed in the record's open tail — never flagged in the
   deliverable.
3. **A decision cited anywhere names its decider and date** — in the record
   doc. "Per a user decision" in a deliverable is doubly wrong: it is
   process residue, and it is unattributed.

**Why a lint check and not a rule.** This practice failed as prose four
times in one repo — the leak recurs because the author writes apparatus at
the moment of doing the work, in the file that is open, and nothing objects.
The portable `doc_lint` therefore carries a residue check (check 6): a
changed deliverable containing verify-later flags, verification/claims
apparatus, unattributed decision references, or retirement lore fails the
gate; record-class files (by name pattern) are exempt. The written rule says
why; the check is what holds.

**Related.** The current-state rule (git is the history) and practice 48
(provenance lives in the index) bound what a deliverable may remember;
practices 24–25 (quote discipline, adversarial pass) generate exactly the
apparatus this practice routes into the record doc.

## 50. Exported tools are one engine plus host shims

A practice that ships tooling (a renderer, a lint, a sync gate) crosses the
repo boundary as **code plus config**, split on one line: **domain-neutral
mechanism lives in the vendored upstream tree and is the single
implementation; everything host-specific — registries, vocabulary, index
names, scan scopes — lives in a thin shim in the host repo** that loads the
vendored module, sets its configuration attributes, and delegates. The
practice text carries the behavior contract (the numbered spec of what the
tool delivers), which is also what lets a host on a different stack
reimplement deliberately rather than accidentally.

**The rule of thumb for what goes where:** if a change would be wanted by
every repo using the tool, it is engine — edit the vendored file, and it
ships upstream at the next check-in; if only this repo would want it, it is
config — edit the shim. A new check, a new interaction, a bug fix: engine.
A new document registered, a new stopword, a different default branch:
shim.

**Why not a fork.** A host that copies the tool and edits its copy is
running two implementations synced by hand. The vendoring audit's drift
hashes will nag, but every improvement is edited twice, and the copies
diverge the first time someone forgets. (Origin: the first dependent repo
maintained renderer, lint, and sync-gate forks in lockstep through one day
of heavy feature work — every change patched twice — then collapsed all
three to shims; behavior was verified identical before and after, the
renderer's output byte-for-byte, and ~1,400 lines of duplicate
implementation disappeared. The collapse also surfaced a latent bug: the
exported sync-gate copy referenced a config name no one had ever defined,
because nothing had ever executed it.)

**Why not spec-only.** A tool's value is its accumulated behavioral detail
— the numeric sort keys that survive currency suffixes, the filter that
survives a column move, the false-positive guards on a check. A dependent
repo reimplementing from prose gets a different-in-a-hundred-ways tool and
re-learns every lesson. Spec and code are not competitors: the spec is the
contract, the vendored code is the reference implementation, and a repo
that can run it should never be writing its own.

**Install.** Vendored tool with module-level configuration attributes and
sane defaults; host shim of a dozen lines (load via an explicit file path
under a distinct module name to avoid shadowing, set attributes, delegate
to the engine's entry point); the manifest entry notes shim status so the
vendoring audit tracks the engine, not the shim. Every host-side runbook
keeps invoking the shim path — the restructure changes no workflows.

**Related.** Practice 44 (shared renderer) and practice 19 (generated-block
sync) are the worked examples; practice 33's "transformations live in code"
is the same instinct one level up; the check-in flow of the vendoring
playbook is how engine changes propagate.

## 51. Every quantity kind prints through one formatter

A reader comparing two table cells must never have to normalize precision
in their head. **Declare one formatter per quantity kind** — tonnage,
volume, money-rate, speed, distance, whatever the domain's comparable
quantities are — **in a single module, and route every emitter that
prints the kind through it.** Never an inline format string: an inline
`f"{x:.1f} t"` is a second, silently divergent copy of the kind's
precision policy, and the divergence prints as "2 t" in one cell and
"2.0 t" in the next.

The formatter object carries the kind's **whole** policy: decimal places,
any threshold above which values print as thousands-separated integers,
approximation marking, unit affixes.

**The underlying rule — representation is a property of the comparison
set, not of the individual value.** Every recurrence of this defect class
has the same shape: the format was computed from one value at a time (a
per-value threshold, per-value significant figures, two "kinds" that in
fact share columns), and any function from a single value to a string can
break set-consistency the moment the set spans it. Choose the
representation once, from the whole set of values that will be compared
together, and apply it to every member. Three policy rules with teeth:

- **Pick precision from the estimate's own noise.** Tenths the model
  cannot resolve are false precision; a kind whose values are rough
  estimates prints coarse everywhere, not just where someone remembered.
- **Check thresholds against the comparison pairs.** A threshold is safe
  only if no two values a reader will compare side by side fall on
  opposite sides of it — a policy that prints one cell as an integer and
  its row-mate with a decimal has recreated the original defect inside
  the formatter.
- **Currency uses the money convention: one fixed decimal count across
  the compared set.** Significant figures are honest about noise but
  print $16 beside $1.4 beside $0.030 — three shapes for one kind, and
  money is the kind readers subconsciously column-align. Fix the decimal
  count for the whole set (verify it still separates every pair actually
  compared; widen it if not), and accept the mild over-precision on the
  large values as the cost of alignment.

**Origin.** A competitive-comparison table printed an incumbent's
capacity as "2 t" beside the fleet's own "2.0 t" in the same row — the
principal flagged it as proof the table was not being read the way a
reader would. The first fix — two ad-hoc helpers inside that one table's
emitter — immediately straddled its own threshold: integers at 100 put
"110" beside "97.8" in the same row, the same defect in new clothes. A
third pass moved the money kind to per-value significant figures — honest
about noise, and still wrong: $16, $1.4, and $0.030 are three shapes of
one kind. Only then did the class close, with the set-level rule above:
every fix until it had computed the format from a single value, and the
requirement was never a property of single values.

**Engine.** `tools/table_fmt.py` (`Qty`): the mechanism — threshold
precision, separators, approximation and affixes — as a tiny class. A
host repo's shim declares its kinds once (practice 50) and its emitters
import the shim. Adopting emitters must reproduce byte-identical output
where the policy is unchanged — the generated-block drift gate
(practice 19) is the proof.

**The formatter↔renderer seam is checked, not remembered.** The sortable
render parses these printed strings back to numbers for sorting,
frontier ranking, and decimal alignment — so the formatter's output
grammar and the renderer's parse grammar are one contract with two
implementations, and nothing about a new notation looks broken until a
table silently mis-sorts it. The engine therefore ships `parse_key()`
(the Python mirror of the renderer's numeric-key grammar; the two are
extended together) and `roundtrip_check()`: every registered kind
formats sample values and the parse must recover the printed value —
the expectation derived from the kind's own declared affixes, so it is
independent of the parser — plus canned grammar pins for the forms that
drift silently (the unit-vs-money "M", the bare decimal). A host shim
exposes this as `self_check()` wired into the repo's audit runner, so a
notation the tables would mis-sort fails at commit time, not in the
browser.

**Related.** Practice 44 (the render layer these cells land in);
practice 33 (transformations live in code — this is its formatting
corner); practice 50 (how the engine crosses the repo boundary).

## 52. A computation that books a transfer names both sides of the ledger

When a model charges one party for what another receives — work for
kinetic energy, spend for inventory, a debit for a credit — the
plausibility check everyone naturally runs is *"does the charge equal
the recipient's gain?"* That check is the trap, not the verification:
**the recipient-side ledger balances by construction.** Charging a
force over the recipient's displacement always yields exactly the
recipient's gain; charging a spend against the goods received always
matches the goods. What that one-sided check can never see is the
term between the parties — dissipation, friction, spoilage, fees —
which the payer also pays, over the **payer's own path**.

The rule: any closed-form gate or feasibility formula that books a
transfer must **(a) name its sources and sinks explicitly** — every
account the quantity can come from and every account it can land in —
and **(b) carry a property self-check asserting the whole-system
inventory closes**, sources equal to sinks within the model's stated
noise. Where an independent integrator or simulation exists, calibrate
the closed form against it and assert the band; where none exists, a
one-line back-of-envelope inventory (is the payer's total available
even of the right order against the sink side?) belongs in the
derivation's comment.

**Why review misses it.** Two compounding effects, both observed in
the origin incident. First, the wrong length is usually the *salient*
one: the mechanism's narrative stars one displacement (the relative
motion, the visible stroke), and that is the length at hand when the
formula is written — while the work integral belongs on the payer's
displacement. Second, direction-of-motion bias: when the erroneous
formula lands inside a commit that is correcting a known error in the
*opposite* direction, the overshoot wears the correction's clothes —
big new numbers read as the fix working. Neither reviewer instinct
(does the charge match the gain? does the change move the right way?)
catches a factor hidden in the dissipation term.

**Origin.** A feasibility gate charged a hauling agent's energy cost
as force × the *load's* displacement rather than the agent's own
path — exactly half, the other half leaving through a dissipative
element between them. The halved charge equaled the load's
kinetic-energy gain to the digit, so the one-sided check passed; the
published capability ceiling came out ~2× optimistic (compounded by a
missing geometric completion condition the same 1-D framing hid) and
survived its thread's otherwise-careful review because it arrived in
a commit raising ceilings a doctrine reread had shown were wrongly
zero. It was caught a day later only when an independent
trajectory integrator's whole-system energy balance refused to close —
and a three-line inventory then showed the payer's entire available
energy was ~3× short of the sink side at the published ceiling. The
correct accounting had existed in the program's own prose for weeks,
written down and executable nowhere — the same lesson as the
model-audit practice, recurring: prose does not fail a build; a
ledger assertion does.

## 53. A TODO is a handoff, not a parking lot

**Rule.** Before writing an open item, ask: *could this session finish it
now?* If yes, do the work — the inclination to queue an agent-doable item is
the signal to do it, not to file it. An item may be queued only for a stated
reason, written into the item itself:

- **blocked-on** — a named external input: a decision (with its owner named),
  a resource, an event, an artifact that does not exist yet; or
- **out-of-scope** — genuinely too large or too tangential for the current
  session, in which case the item must carry the context a cold session
  needs: why it matters, the intended approach, and the pointers.

"Would enlarge this turn" is not a reason; it is the moment the context is
cheapest. A sweep that finds an open item with neither reason either does it
in the sweeping session or closes it as not worth doing.

**Why.** A queued item sheds context every day it waits. The session that
noticed the need holds the reasoning, the file locations, and the half-formed
approach — and almost none of that survives into a one-line queue entry, so
deferral converts cheap work into expensive work, and often into work never
done. The catalog already outlaws deferral for two special cases — capture
happens in the thread that created the need (practice 10), and the
inclination to write a verify-later marker means go verify now (practice
49) — because both learned that the queue is where context goes to die. This
generalizes the same insight to ordinary work: the typed TODO exists to hand
work *across a genuine boundary* (to a human decision, to hardware, to a
session with the right scope), not to spare the current session effort.
Origin: a session queued two follow-up items from its own build — both
labeled agent-doable, one of them a half-hour mechanical change — and the
owner asked why work needing no input from them was parked at all. Both
