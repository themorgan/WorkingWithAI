# Precedent — Rewrite Plan (Approved)

**Status: APPROVED by Morgan, 2026-08-31. This is the plan of record — build
from it.** Written to be read cold, by a session or a person with no access to
the conversation that produced it. Everything needed to build it is here.

Changes from here on are amendments to an approved plan, not edits to a draft:
state what changed and why, and keep the version header current.

## What This Is

A plan to restructure [BestPractice](https://github.com/alex137/BestPractice)
and [RepoPersonalPreferences](https://github.com/themorgan/RepoPersonalPreferences)
(RPP) into **Precedent**: a single practice engine where practices are stored
as structured data, loaded only when relevant, layered by who they belong to,
and scoped by what they apply to.

Three goals drive everything below.

1. **Stop loading everything every time.** Load only what the task at hand
   needs. The splitting, indexing, and trimming all serve this.
2. **Give decisions and their history an organized home**, out of the working
   task list they currently overwhelm.
3. **Make the protocol build itself as you work** — the system notices what
   should become a practice and proposes it, you approve, and it routes and
   enforces from there. This is the product's core claim; see
   [How a Practice Comes Into Existence](#how-a-practice-comes-into-existence).

Precedent is built **on a branch of BestPractice itself**, not as a fork
(amended 2026-08-31; see [Amendments Since Approval](#amendments-since-approval)).
Alex owns BestPractice and is roughly 80% convinced, so **merge-back is likely
but not assured** — the plan is still built so the work can stand alone if it
has to, which on a branch means being extractable into a fork later rather
than being one already.

## For the Session Implementing This

**Work phase by phase, in order, and do not skip ahead.** The sequence is
deliberate: each phase makes the next cheap, and the reverse order makes each
one expensive. Finish a phase's done-when condition before starting the next.

**Copy this document into Precedent as the first act of phase 0.** It currently
lives in RepoPersonalPreferences, which a session working in Precedent will not
have. Precedent is where it belongs.

**Do not try to hold the whole plan in context while building.** Read the
architecture sections once, then work from the phase you are on. A plan about
loading only what the task needs should be used that way.

**The first action is taking the pending BestPractice update.** Upstream is at
`88ecf7f`; RPP vendors `c76f06f`. Branch from a current base, not a stale one —
divergence from upstream is the top risk in this plan, and starting behind
makes it worse on day one.

**RepoPersonalPreferences is the first migration target, not only a source.**
It stays live and in use throughout; it is the repo whose practices are being
split three ways, and it should be migrated before any other consumer repo,
because it is the one whose failure modes are understood.

## Why — The Diagnosis

### The Bet Is Right; the Growth Undermines It

BestPractice's premise is sound: put accumulated judgment in the repo, load it
into the model, enforce what can be enforced with scripts. The problem is that
**the system has no notion of relevance** — every practice loads for every
task, whether or not it could apply.

This is not a cost complaint. **Past a certain size, adding a practice makes
the model follow the other practices worse.** Attention is finite and
undifferentiated: a commit-trailer convention competes on equal footing with
the practice that actually governs the task. At twenty practices the dilution
is invisible. At fifty, on a task where three apply, the model reads
forty-seven rules that can only distract from the three. **An irrelevant rule
is not neutral — it is noise that degrades the signal from the relevant ones.**

So the architecture has a perverse property: **it punishes the exact behavior
the philosophy asks for.** Every captured lesson taxes every future session
forever, and past some point the tax is paid in adherence, not just tokens.

### The Evidence

Measured on RPP over 2026-08-27 → 2026-08-29:

| Figure | Value |
|---|---|
| Personal-pack rules | 21 → 29 → 46 in three days |
| [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) size | 29,443 → 71,059 bytes |
| Always-loaded context | ≈ 17,800 tokens, every session, before any work |
| Full-text copies of each rule | 3, all hand-maintained |
| Rules enforced by a script | 2 of 46 |
| Commits touching the rule file | 38 in the window |
| BestPractice's own catalogue | 51 practices, median 38 lines, longest 118 |
| By-number `practice N` citations | 169, across BestPractice and one consumer |

A deep check on 2026-08-29 found six consistency defects. **Four were the same
failure** — a rule edited in its canonical home and not in the copies the
install procedure creates: commits `1c6fedf`, `cdd18d7`, `b56fc32`, `b52de2e`.
Two shipped as broken references aimed at downstream repos: a vendored rule
citing "merge runbook step 5" when the install procedure never created a step
5, and a harness hook added with its file, manifest entry and wiring all
correct that no install step ever referenced.

Three findings matter more than the defect count:

- **The rules were loaded and were skipped anyway.** Every one of those four
  commits came from a session carrying all 46 rules in context, including the
  rule requiring the mirroring it skipped. **Residency does not produce
  compliance at this size.** The two script-enforced rules were never violated.
- **Five of six were found by throwaway scripts, not by reading.** Every
  existing gate validates the file you touched; every one of these defects is
  a fact about a file you did not touch.
- **BestPractice's own anti-bloat rule was loaded and did not fire.** Practice
  20 carries an explicit proportionality guard — *"Not every slip earns a
  rule… Prefer strengthening an existing rule or audit over minting a new one
  — rule-bloat is itself a failure mode."* It was resident for all 25 rules
  added that weekend. The thesis demonstrating itself.

### Everything Else the Review Turned Up

The full list of problems this rewrite must solve, beyond the headline one.
Each names where the plan addresses it.

| Problem found | Addressed in |
|---|---|
| Decision history has no home; grew to 1,013 of [TODO.md](TODO.md)'s 1,187 lines, and regrew within a day of being condensed | [Where Decisions and History Live](#where-decisions-and-history-live) |
| A change in one place silently implies a change elsewhere, and nothing knows (the four drift commits; the dangling "step 5"; the uninstalled hook) | Generated views, phase 2 |
| Navigation documents ([MAP.md](MAP.md), [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md)) hand-maintained and drifting — stale counts, missing files, missing terms | Generated views, phase 2 |
| No gate records that it ran; "considered and found nothing" is indistinguishable from "never asked" | [Gate Receipts](#gate-receipts) |
| Nothing retires a practice; the catalogue cannot shrink | [Lifecycle](#lifecycle--practices-must-be-able-to-die) |
| The anti-bloat guard is prose competing with fifty other prose rules | [The Resident Budget](#the-resident-budget) and [Promotion Criteria](#stage-3--promotion-criteria) |
| No way to note something without promoting it to a resident rule, so everything worth noticing became one — 21 to 46 rules in three days | [The Candidate](#stage-2--the-candidate) |
| Only 2 of 46 practices mechanically enforced; `fail-gracefully` asserted, never tested | Phase 5 |
| [checkin.py](process/upstream/tools/checkin.py) `fresh` is silent on failure, so unreachable reads as "current" | Phase 1 |
| Practices cited by position (169 by-number references), making insertion a cross-repo sweep | Slugs, phase 1 |
| An unresolved drift notice re-stamps its own date every session, so every session inherits a diff it did not create | Phase 1 tooling pass |
| The export path is one-way in practice — RPP has essentially never checked anything in | Phase 7, and the branch's re-sync discipline |

### Why Trimming Is Not the Answer

The tempting conclusion is "it got too big, trim it." **Trimming is a
treadmill.** RPP's decisions log was condensed to one line per entry on
2026-08-28 (`02a24a7`) and had fully regrown within a day, because the
pressure that produced the text had not changed. This plan does the opposite:
**decouple the size of the catalogue from the cost of having it**, so it can
hold hundreds of practices without the resident set moving.

## The Architecture

### Vocabulary (Use These Words)

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Practice** | The unit. One file. Replaces both BestPractice's "practice" and RPP's "rule" as the name of the thing. |
| **Rule** | The imperative section *inside* a practice — one to three sentences. Not a synonym for practice. |
| **Source** | Where a practice comes from and who may see it: Precedent, a Team set, or an Individual set. |
| **Universal source** | The Precedent catalogue itself, vendored into a consumer repo at `process/upstream/` and tracked in its `process/manifest.json`. Every consumer repo has one. |
| **Team source** | A team's own shared conventions, kept in the team's own repo and declared in a consumer repo's `precedent.json` — resolved live from a sibling checkout, never vendored, because the team already maintains it independently. *(Added 2026-09-02, against a real gap found installing a team source for the first time in a dependent repo: this term and Individual source below weren't named on their own, only folded into Source's definition — see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) §1 step 9.)* |
| **Individual source** | One person's own facts — commit identity, a timezone, a personal shorthand — kept in their own private repo and declared only in their own user-level config (`~/.config/precedent/config.json`, or `PRECEDENT_USER_CONFIG`), never in any shared repo's tracked files. The one case a consumer repo's own `precedent.json` refuses by name. |
| **Precedent** | The public repo: the engine, the checks, and the universal practice catalogue. BestPractice itself, restructured — the work lands on a branch and merges back. |
| **Consumer repo** | Any project that uses practices. |
| **Resolved set** | What a given repo and person actually get after merging their sources. |
| **Resident** | Loaded into every session. The opposite is on-demand. |
| **Vendored copy** | A source's practices copied into a consumer repo and tracked there, rather than fetched live. |
| **Approver** | Whoever must say yes before a practice enters a shared set. Our word, not GitHub's. |

**A vocabulary note, because most users of this will not be writing software.** Approvers are *implemented* with GitHub's `CODEOWNERS` file, which maps path patterns to required reviewers and works on any file type. That is an implementation detail and should stay one: nothing user-facing should say "code owners" to someone who is writing a strategy memo. The same applies to every other borrowed term — say **approver**, **proposal**, **approved**, not *reviewer*, *pull request*, *merged* — following BestPractice practice 34, outward-facing documents use the reader's words.

### The Practice File

One file per practice. Three sections with different lifetimes, plus
frontmatter that is the machine-readable half.

```
practices/document-references-are-links.md

---
slug:        document-references-are-links   # permanent identity; cited by name

## Rule
Three sentences, imperative. The only text ever resident in context.

## Detail
The operational specifics — numbered policy rules, worked procedures,
sub-rules with their own tests. Normative, but not needed to decide
whether the practice applies. Loaded when actually doing the work.

## Why
A paragraph. Loaded when someone opens the practice to question or change it.

## Story
The originating incident, dated. Never loaded. Never trimmed.

## Install
What a dependent repo does about it: template paths, tool names, wiring.
```

`source` is deliberately **not** a field — it is implied by which repo the
file lives in, so it cannot drift from reality.

**Why splitting Rule from Why from Story is the highest-value change:**
BestPractice's median
practice is 38 lines; the instruction inside it is three or four. Splitting
removes roughly nine tenths of the resident text **without deleting a word**,
and gives the incident history a permanent home.

**Amended 2026-08-31, against measurement.** The estimate above was wrong for
this catalogue, and `## Detail` and `## Install` above are the correction.
Phase 1.5's editorial pass ([spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md](spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md))
split all 52 practices four ways and `## Rule` came out at **40%** of the
corpus, not a tenth — because a large share of each practice is genuinely
*normative* text that is neither reasoning, nor an incident, nor wiring:
numbered policy rules, worked decision procedures, sub-rules with their own
tests. With nowhere else to go, it stayed in `Rule` and kept `Rule` long
(twenty practices still exceed 150 words). `## Detail` is that home. Splitting
it out is **phase 3 work** — see the Sequence table — because the machinery
that makes it cheap already exists and doing it after consumer repos vendor
the format is an order of magnitude more expensive.

### How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load

This is the heart of the design, so it is specified as a procedure rather than
a principle. **Nothing here requires the model to decide what is relevant from
a wall of text; each step is either mechanical or a lookup against an index.**

**At session start**, the harness loads one generated file containing exactly
three things:

1. **The resident block** — the full `## Rule` text of every `tier: resident`
   practice in the resolved set. Target ≈2,000 tokens, hard-capped (see
   [The Resident Budget](#the-resident-budget)).
2. **The occasion index** — one line per on-demand practice, grouped by
   occasion. This is the routing table, and it is cheap because each entry is
   a slug plus a clause:

   ```
   When writing or editing a document:
     document-references-are-links — references are links; ≈ not ~
     bold-key-phrases             — bold the key phrases; do not overdo it
     trim-prose                   — trim after any substantial edit
   When merging a branch:
     routing-audit   — run the three audits, then the coherence review
     todo-gate       — reconcile TODO.md before pushing
   When adding a practice:
     new-practice-placement — narrowest level first; renumber nothing
   ```

3. **The standing instruction**: *before starting work of a kind named in the
   index, read the practices listed for it.* One sentence, resident.

**During the session**, three further channels fire without the model having
to remember anything:

- **Path-triggered.** A `PreToolUse` hook matches the edited file against
  every practice's `applies_to` globs and prints the matching `## Rule`
  sections. This is what makes document- and folder-scoped practices real, and
  it is the only channel that works even when the model has forgotten the
  index exists.
- **Gate-triggered.** Runbook steps cite slugs; reaching the step loads them.
  A merge loads exactly the merge practices, at the moment of merging.
- **Enforced.** Practices with `checked_by` are never loaded at all. The
  check's failure message *is* the rule, delivered at the moment of violation.

**Worked example.** A session is asked to edit `book/CHAPTER1.md`.

1. Resident block is already in context: ≈12 practices, ~2,000 tokens.
2. The model reads the occasion index line "When writing or editing a
   document" and opens those three practices — ~15 lines each.
3. The `PreToolUse` hook fires on the path, matching
   `book/doc-recipes/CHAPTER1.recipe.md` (a practice with
   `applies_to: ["book/CHAPTER1.md"]`) and prints its Rule.
4. On merge, the gate loads the merge-time practices.
5. Link formatting, header capitalization and date formats are never loaded;
   they are checks that fail if violated.

Total in context: the resident block plus perhaps five practices, instead of
all of them.

#### Loading a Practice Means Loading Its Rule, Not Its File

A practice is one file holding Rule, Why and Story, and **Story is the
largest part**. If a triggered load were an ordinary read of that file, the
whole saving would evaporate at exactly the moment a practice is used — the
agent would pull in the history it will never need in order to reach three
sentences it does.

**So the agent never reads a practice file directly.** It calls a command,
and only the command's output enters context:

```
precedent show doc-references-are-links bold-key-phrases
    → the ## Rule section of each, and nothing else

precedent show doc-references-are-links --why
    → the reasoning, when deciding whether the practice really applies
      or when the user challenges it

precedent show doc-references-are-links --story
    → the originating incident. Archaeology only; almost never called.
```

Three consequences worth stating:

- **One code path.** The occasion index, the path-triggered hook and the gate
  steps all shell out to the same command, so there is no second extractor to
  drift from the first.
- **A fallback for harnesses that cannot run commands.** The build emits a
  rules-only bundle — every Rule, no Why, no Story — as a generated view like
  any other. Less precise than the command, still far smaller than the files.
- **`## Rule` goes first in the file**, so even a naive full read front-loads
  the part that matters.

This also makes the escalation natural rather than special-cased: a session
starts with rules only, and reaches for a Why exactly when it is about to
reason about a practice rather than follow it.

**The failure mode this introduces**, stated plainly because it is the
design's real weak point: **a practice with a wrong or missing trigger is
worse than one buried in a wall of text, because nobody notices its absence.**
Three mitigations. Two are mechanical and one-off: the reachability check
(every on-demand practice must have at least one of `checked_by`, a
narrower-than-`**` `applies_to`, or an `occasion`) and behavioral replay in
the verification harness. The third runs forever, and is described next.

#### The Routing Audit Checks Coverage, Not Content

Loading less does risk a practice going unapplied, so the periodic routing
audit becomes the standing safety net. **But it must not do this by reading
every practice with the whole diff in context** — that is the load-everything
failure moved to a different moment, and a review holding two hundred
practices suffers exactly the dilution this design exists to remove. It would
simply fail less often, because it runs less often.

So the routing audit asks a narrower and far cheaper question. **Not "did we
follow every practice?" but "did every practice that should have fired,
fire?"** Three parts:

- **A coverage audit, fully mechanical, every run.** For the work on this
  branch, compute which practices' `applies_to` globs match the changed files,
  and compare that against which practices the session actually loaded.
  Anything that matched by path but was never surfaced is a **routing
  failure** — reported with the practice and the file that should have pulled
  it in. This needs no extra context at all, because it compares two lists.
- **A rotating deep read, not a full sweep.** Each run takes a slice of the
  catalogue — the practices that have fired least recently, and those with no
  `checked_by` — and reads those properly against the actual work. Over
  successive runs the whole catalogue gets covered, without any single run
  drowning in it.
- **Attention spent where checks cannot reach.** A practice with a working
  `checked_by` needs no human-style review: the check either fired or it did
  not. The rotating read therefore skips those entirely and spends itself on
  the practices that can only be judged, which is both the smaller set and
  the one that actually needs judgment.

**What the routing audit produces is fixes to the routing, not just to the
work.** A practice found applicable-but-unrouted twice is a candidate for a
narrower glob, a better occasion, or — best — a check that makes the question
moot. That feeds the retirement-and-promotion report rather than accumulating
as a list of misses.

**And its honest limit, stated so nobody leans on it too hard:** this is a
detective control, not a preventive one. It finds misses after the fact. The
preventive controls are triggers and checks, and the routing audit's real
value is improving *those* — because a system that relies on a big periodic
review pass to catch what it should have enforced is the mechanism that
already demonstrably failed here.

**On the resident budget squeezing out something important:** that is what
`severity` and the hard cap are for together. If a practice must always be
resident and the budget is full, something else has to be demoted, chosen
deliberately rather than by whatever happened to be added last. A practice
pushed out of the resident set should preferably gain a check instead of a
smaller font.

### Source — Who a Practice Belongs To

Four levels. **The repo is public**, which decides the shape.

| Level | Lives in | Visible to | Decided by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Universal** | Precedent, public | Everyone | Precedent's maintainer, via PR |
| **Team** | One private repo per team | That team | That set's **approvers** — a review *is* the decision |
| **Individual** | One private repo per person | Only that person | The person. No review. |
| **Repo-local** | The consuming repo itself | Everyone with access to that repo | Whoever can commit to that repo |

**Levels are repositories, not directories inside one repository — with one
named exception.** The tempting arrangement is a single repo with
`universal/`, `team/` and `individual/` side by side, and it does not survive
contact with a public Precedent: **individual practices must never be
world-readable.** A practice's level is really a statement about its source,
and sources are enforced by repo boundaries. Repo-local is the one level that
genuinely **is** "a directory inside the repo" rather than a separate
repository — and that is fine specifically because it carries none of the
world-readability risk the other three levels are structured around: a
repo-local practice is already exactly as visible as everything else in
that repo, to everyone who can already read it.

**Recommended: a subdirectory (`path: "local"`, holding `local/practices/`),
not the bare repo root (`path: "."`).** Either satisfies "never leaves the
repo" — `tools/precedent_resolve.py`'s own validation only refuses a path
OUTSIDE the declaring repo — but `path: "."` puts repo-local's own
hand-authored `practices/` in the exact same place
`tools/precedent_materialize.py`'s resolved output goes when a repo
materializes into its own root, which is the ordinary way a consuming repo
regenerates its own `AGENTS.md`. Reproduced, not hypothetical: materializing
a `path: "."` repo-local source into that same repo's own root silently
overwrote the hand-authored source file the moment another source won
resolution on a shared slug — no crash, no warning, just different content
on disk than the person wrote, with nothing left to show it had changed.
A subdirectory keeps the two physically apart: the hand-authored source at
`local/practices/`, the generated, resolved view at the repo's own
`practices/`, never colliding regardless of which source wins any given
slug.

See PRACTICES.md
practice 23 (layered-practice-packs) for what belongs at this level in the
first place — a rule true only of one repo's own subject matter, never
exported, never vendored in from anywhere.

**Why one repo per team rather than directories in one private repo.** Git
permissions are per-repo; a directory boundary inside a shared repo is a
convention, not a control. The teams here are mutually unrelated, so a shared
repo would let each team read the others' practices — a defect, not a
tradeoff. One repo per team also gives per-team approvers, per-team
credentials when those arrive, and the ability to retire a team without
touching the rest. It costs more repos and makes cross-team promotion a
cross-repo move; a template repo plus a one-command creation script covers the
friction.

#### Where Today's Practices Go

The migration is a three-way split, and the allocation is decided now rather
than practice by practice later.

| Today | Goes to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **BestPractice's 51 practices** | **Universal**, in Precedent | They are already public and already the shared baseline. Keeping them where they are requires no decision and imposes nothing new on anyone. |
| **RPP's 46 rules**, by default | **Team** (`precedent-team-maintainers`) | They are one small group's working conventions, not everybody's. Publishing them as universal would impose them on every Precedent user, which is not what they are. |
| **The Morgan-specific handful** | **Individual** (`precedent-individual`) | Commit identity, Buenos Aires timezone, the name in a file header, GitHub attribution, pronouns, the `go`/`merge` shorthand — facts about one person, and RPP already identifies exactly these under its `morgan-scope` rule. |

**Default all of RPP to team even where a practice looks generic.** Several
plainly are — graceful failure, platform-neutral integrations, not stating
counts that drift, linking what you cite. Promote those to universal
individually, with the approval that requires. **The asymmetry is the reason:**
promoting team to universal is a designed path, while demoting a universal
practice means it has already been published and imposed on everyone using
Precedent. Narrowest first, as everywhere else in this plan.

**Two RPP rules should die in the migration rather than move**, which is worth
doing deliberately as the first exercise of the lifecycle:

- `morgan-scope`, a meta-rule declaring which facts are Morgan-specific. **The
  level now says that**, so the rule has nothing left to do.
- `bestpractice-wins`, declaring that the personal layer overrides the generic
  one. **Precedence is a property of the engine now**, not something to write
  down and hope is read.

Both are cases where a written rule existed only because the structure could
not express the thing. That is the retirement path working as intended, and a
useful signal to look for elsewhere in the 46.

#### One Individual Set per Person, Not per Team

**A person has exactly one individual set, however many teams they belong to.**
Three teams means three team repos and still one personal repo. A practice like
*"always write my name in capitals"* is written once and follows its author
into every repo they work in — never copied, never re-approved, never
remembered three times.

**Who declares which sources is therefore split, and this matters for
privacy.** A shared repo may only name the sources everyone in it can read:

- **The consumer repo** declares universal plus its team set, in a tracked
  config file. Everyone working there gets those.
- **The person** declares their own individual set in their *user-level*
  config, outside any shared repo.

If a project repo named someone's individual set, it would leak that set's
existence and location to everyone on the team, and their sessions would try
to fetch a repository they cannot read. So it does not. Two people working in
the same repo resolve **different** sets, each seeing their own personal
practices and neither seeing the other's.

#### What You Actually Open to Do Work — One Repo

**A person making a small change opens exactly one repository: the project
they are working on.** Practice sets are dependencies, not repositories you
attach per session. If using this system meant adding three repos before
touching anything, nobody would use it, and the friction would fall hardest on
the smallest changes — the ones that should be cheapest.

How each source actually arrives:

| Source | How it gets there | Cost at work time |
|---|---|---|
| **Universal** | Vendored into the project repo as tracked files, exactly as BestPractice is vendored today | None — already on disk |
| **Team** | Vendored the same way. Everyone with access to the project can see the team's practices anyway, so there is nothing to protect | None — already on disk |
| **Individual** | A local clone in the person's own environment, named in their user-level config | None — already on disk |

Nothing is fetched from a remote when a session starts. **This is not a new
idea; it is BestPractice's existing vendoring model**, whose whole argument is
that live coupling breaks sessions exactly when orientation matters most. The
background sync workflows keep the vendored copies current, which is machinery
that already exists.

**Two cases worth naming.** A fresh cloud session with no persistent home
directory has no local individual set, so it clones one at bootstrap from the
person's config — a setup step, not a repo the user attaches. And if that
clone fails, the session **degrades gracefully**: it runs on universal plus
team and says plainly that personal practices are missing, rather than
pretending they were applied.

#### Precedence, and the One Case Precedence Alone Does Not Decide

The engine resolves with **precedence: team > repo-local > individual >
universal** (reordered 2026-09-03; originally individual > team > universal —
see below for why). A practice may name a lower-source slug in `overrides:`;
the resolver fails loudly if two same-level practices claim one slug.

**Noted here, not to belabor it: the order reflects each level's actual
authority, not the reverse.** A team's rules bind everyone in it — the
closest thing here to actual law for that group — so team ranks highest.
Universal covers every Precedent user in the world and is, by design, the
lowest common denominator: the weakest claim on any one person or team, so it
ranks lowest. An individual's own practices sit in between: more binding than
something meant to work for the whole world, less binding than what a
person's own team actually requires of them. Repo-local sits alongside that
same ladder, between individual and team, since it speaks to one specific
repo's own working reality rather than a person's general style.

**The exception is what `severity: blocking` is for.** A practice at any
level below the top of that order may be marked `severity: blocking`, which
means no source ranked above it can override it by precedence alone — a
universal information-leak guard a team must not be able to quietly turn off
for itself, say. Everything else, plain precedence decides. This is the
difference between a practice about *how something is done* and a practice
about *what must never happen*, and marking it is the call of whoever
approves the practice that needs the protection.

Nothing above is a hard ceiling on any one practice, either: `overrides:` and
`severity: blocking` both exist precisely so a specific rule can depart from
the default order when it needs to, at whichever level actually needs the
exception. The table is a default, not a constraint.

### Scope — What a Practice Applies To

**Scope is written as paths, which makes it a trigger a machine can evaluate.**
"Applies only to `CHAPTER1.md`" and "applies when editing a document" are the
same kind of statement; one is simply precise enough to check. So scope is
`applies_to`, a list of globs defaulting to `["**"]` — not a separate
classification a person has to maintain alongside the trigger, but the same
thing said exactly.

- Folder scope and document scope fall out for free.
- **Document recipes stop being a parallel mechanism.** A recipe becomes a
  practice whose `applies_to` is a single file, stored beside that document.
  Same format, loader, and checks — removing a subsystem instead of adding one.
- A glob is checkable; a prose occasion is not. Prefer globs, and keep
  `occasion` for what globs cannot express (merging, installing, releasing).

### Where Decisions and History Live

Three different things are currently jammed into one working list. They
separate cleanly:

| What | Goes to | Loaded? |
|---|---|---|
| Why a practice exists — its originating incident | That practice's `## Story` section | Never |
| A decision that is not about a practice ("the sync merges unattended", "we chose X over Y") | `decisions/<date>-<slug>.md` — one file each, append-only, never pruned | Never |
| Work that is still open | [TODO.md](TODO.md) | Never; it is read, not injected |

**The rule that keeps it that way is mechanical, not aspirational:
[TODO.md](TODO.md) may not contain a `- [x]` item at all.** Closing an item means
moving it — into a practice's Story, into a decision record, or deleting it if
it was trivial. A checked box there fails the check. This is the
smallest rule that would have prevented 1,013 lines of completed decisions
accumulating in a working list, and unlike "condense periodically" it needs no
judgment and cannot regrow.

A decision record carries frontmatter — date, the question, the decision, the
alternatives considered, who decided — so decisions are queryable rather than
prose to be grepped.

### Gate Receipts

Today a session that considered the capture gate and found nothing is
indistinguishable from one that never asked. Each gate emits a receipt into
the merge commit's trailer:

```
Gates: capture=none export=none todo=updated deep-check=passed
```

Cheap, mechanical, and required by the audit on every merge commit. It does
not prove the thinking happened, but it makes **omission visible**, which is
the class of failure that produced every defect in the review.

### The Resident Budget

Practice 20's proportionality guard failed because it was prose competing with
fifty other prose rules. The replacement is structural:

- **The generated resident block has a hard token ceiling.** Exceeding it
  fails the build. Adding a resident practice therefore forces demoting or
  retiring another — the defended core, mechanically defended.
- **Every new practice must declare a reachable channel** or it cannot be
  added at all.
- **A periodic report** lists practices with no `checked_by`, never cited, or
  superseded — the pressure toward enforcement and retirement that nothing
  currently supplies.

### Severity, Not Ranking

Every practice carries `severity: blocking | default | advisory`.

**Deliberately not a global priority ranking.** A total order over fifty-plus
practices cannot be maintained, gets assigned arbitrarily, and drifts silently
— the exact failure this plan exists to fix. What a ranking is wanted for is
conflict resolution, and that is served by source precedence plus three
buckets people can assign correctly. `checked_by` carries the other half of
"how strongly enforced", and is verifiable rather than asserted: a
`checked_by` naming a script with no test for it fails the audit.

### Lifecycle — Practices Must Be Able to Die

The current system has no removal path at all. This one has:

- `status: active | superseded | retired`, with `supersedes: [slug…]` on the
  replacement so provenance survives.
- **Promotion**, the normal life of a good practice: individual → team →
  universal. A file move plus a scrub plus a PR to the higher source.
- **A mechanical promotion signal.** *The same practice restated in a second
  scope was never scope-specific* — RPP's `doc-recipe` rule generalized. Once
  practices are data this is queryable, so the system proposes promotions
  instead of waiting for someone to notice.

## How a Practice Comes Into Existence

This is the product's core claim — *work normally, and the protocol around
that work builds itself* — so it is specified as carefully as the loading
model. **The automation sits at the two ends: the system notices, and the
system enforces. A human approves in the middle.**

That middle step is a feature, not friction. An agent that mints its own
binding rules unsupervised is exactly how RPP reached 46 rules in three days,
and a catalogue nobody vetted is a catalogue nobody trusts.

**A connection worth reasoning about before building Stage 1, flagged by a
2026-09-01 deep-check audit and not yet resolved either way.**
[spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md](spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md)'s sharpest result is
that a session asked to *retrospectively judge a finished thing against a
set of practices* — not to plan work, to judge it after the fact — caps out
around 50–54% recall no matter how much context or choice it is given
(measured three separate ways: a one-line clause, a clause plus a summary,
and a real second hop to the full text). Stage 1's "session judgment at a
gate" and Stage 3's promotion criteria (recurrence, non-duplication) both
ask a session to do exactly that shape of task — judge a completed or
proposed thing against the existing catalogue, after the work is done. It
is not established that this transfers: judging one candidate incident is
not the same task as judging a whole diff against 52 practices, and the
review arm's actual failure mode (per
[the case-level diagnosis](spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md#why-it-landed-below-the-loaders-own-working-session-recall-not-just-below-control))
was never getting more than a one-line clause on most candidates, which a
detection gate showing the actual incident does not have to repeat. But
nobody has reasoned about it in writing, and the plan's own discipline —
measure before building, per phase 2's whole premise — argues for doing
that reasoning explicitly before Stage 1 is built, not discovering the
answer the way phase 2's own premise was discovered: by shipping it first.

### Stage 1 — Detection

Three signal sources, where today there is only the first.

**Session judgment at a gate.** The existing capture, export and review gates,
unchanged in spirit — but now they produce a proposal rather than a commit.

**Explicit instruction.** When the user says *"from now on"*, *"always"*,
*"never"*, *"going forward"*, that is the highest-signal moment the system
will ever get, and today it is handled ad hoc. It becomes a first-class
trigger.

**Mechanical signals from the repo**, which is what makes the system feel
automatic rather than diligent:

- the user reverted, rewrote, or corrected work a session produced;
- the same instruction has now appeared in a second session;
- the same check has failed repeatedly, meaning the practice needs a stronger
  channel rather than more prose;
- a review found a defect (BestPractice practice 20's trigger, detected
  instead of remembered);
- a practice has been restated in a second scope, which is the promotion
  signal.

### Stage 2 — The Candidate

**Detection produces a candidate, never a practice.** This is the
load-bearing change, and the likely root cause of the weekend: **the current
system offers no way to note something without promoting it to a resident
rule.** The only moves are "write a full practice" or "do nothing", so
everything worth noticing became a rule.

A candidate is a dated file in `candidates/`: what was observed, the evidence
(commit, quote, failing check), a proposed rule sentence, a proposed level and
channel. **Never loaded into context.** Creating one costs nothing; ignoring
one costs nothing. Candidates expire on their own if never promoted.

### Stage 3 — Promotion Criteria

Where the proportionality guard stops being prose and becomes a gate. A
candidate becomes a practice only if it passes all four:

1. **Recurrence or real cost** — it happened twice, or once expensively.
   Checkable now, because candidates are dated records rather than memories.
2. **Reachability** — a check can be written, a glob can scope it, or an
   occasion names it. **If none of the three, it cannot become an on-demand
   practice**; it either earns a resident slot or stays a candidate.
3. **Non-duplication** — a query across existing practices for overlap. This
   is what lets the system *propose strengthening an existing practice*
   instead of minting a new one — something BestPractice asks for in prose but
   cannot mechanically support.
4. **Budget** — a candidate wanting to be resident must displace something.

### Stage 4 — Approval, by Level

| Level | Who approves | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Individual** | The person | *"Yes, do it"* in the session is the approval. No proposal document, no review, no waiting. Recorded as `approved_by` with a date. |
| **Team** | That set's approvers | The session proposes; an approver says yes. Implemented as a review on the team repo, so the approval *is* the record. |
| **Universal** | Precedent's maintainer | A PR to Precedent. |

**The session always proposes a level with a reason, defaulting to the
narrowest.** Confirming costs one word. Asking on every practice trains the
user to wave it through, which RPP's `rule-scope-ask` already warns about, so
the proposal carries a guess rather than an open question. The test for
genericity is written there: **would this practice's text still make sense
applied to a different document, or in someone else's repo?**

#### Who the Approvers Are, and How They Get That Job

**Approvers are declared in the practice set's own config**, not in a
host-specific file — a short list of people who may say yes to a change in
that set. GitHub's `CODEOWNERS` is then *generated* from that list, the same
way every other view in this system is generated, so there is one source and
the platform enforcement derives from it rather than competing with it.

Declaring them in the set itself buys two things a host file cannot. The
engine can **read** the list, so a session can tell you *"this needs Fabian's
approval"* instead of leaving you to work it out. And the design survives
moving off GitHub, which a `CODEOWNERS` file does not.

- **At creation**, whoever creates a team set is its first approver. No
  ceremony, and there is always at least one.
- **Adding or removing an approver is itself a change to the set**, so it
  needs the current approvers' approval. That is self-hosting and stops
  someone quietly adding themselves.
- **The individual level has no approvers** — the owner is the only one, by
  definition.
- **If a set's only approver becomes unavailable**, the repository's admin can
  reset the list. Worth documenting rather than building around; it is a
  recovery path, not a workflow.

#### How an Approver Finds Out

A proposal nobody sees is a proposal that never happens, and this system
already has a recorded lesson about exactly that: an earlier automation
reported its blockers only as a build-log annotation, which lives inside one
run that nobody opens unless they already know to look. **The fix then was to
report where people already are, and the same rule applies here.**

Three channels, in order of how reliably they land:

- **The proposal itself, where they already get notified.** Requesting an
  approver's review triggers their existing account notifications — email,
  mobile, whatever they already have — with no notification system to build.
- **In-session, when they next work anywhere that uses the set.** *"Three
  practice proposals are waiting for you."* This is the highest-signal
  channel, because they are already in the tool with the context loaded, and
  it is the same mechanism this repo built for drift notices after a
  stdout-only notice lost a priority fight against whatever task was already
  in front of the session.
- **A periodic digest** to the set's approvers, so a proposal that slipped
  past both of the above does not sit forever.

**The proposer is told immediately what happens next** — who must approve, that
the proposal is open, and that they can use the practice at their individual
level meanwhile. Never leave the person who raised it guessing.

**Proposals expire.** One nobody acts on is closed after a set period and the
proposer is told, rather than accumulating into a queue nobody reads — the
same reasoning that makes candidates expire.

**A caveat, tied to an open decision below.** All three channels above assume
an approver comfortable with a code-review notification. Many people using
this will be working on documents rather than software, and for them the
interface likely needs to be an approval requested and given in a session,
with the repo write happening behind it. The channels are right; the surface
may not be.

### Stage 5 — Landing

On approval the practice file is written into the right repo and **every
generated view regenerates** — the resident block, the occasion index, the
catalogue, the map, the glossary. That is the phase-2 machinery doing the work
that four hand-maintained copies do badly today.

One rule held firmly: **a practice claiming `checked_by` is not finished until
that check exists and has a test proving it fires.** Otherwise "we will
enforce it later" is precisely how a catalogue arrives at 44 of 46 unenforced.

#### Landing a Team Practice While Working in a Project — the Round Trip

The common case, spelled out because it crosses a repository boundary and the
wrong instinct here is a well-known trap.

You are working in a project that has your team's practices **vendored** — a
copy of them tracked inside the project. Mid-session you decide something
should become a team practice. The vocabulary for what follows is standard
dependency management:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Vendored copy** | The dependency's files, copied into your project and tracked there |
| **Upstreaming** | Sending your change back to the dependency's own repo, so it becomes part of the real thing. BestPractice's own word for this is *check-in* |
| **Syncing** | Pulling the dependency's newer version down into your vendored copy |
| **Clobbering** | What happens to a change made *only* in the vendored copy: the next sync silently reverts it |

**The rule that follows from that last row: never write a new practice into
the vendored copy.** It appears to work, the practice loads, everything looks
right — and then the next sync overwrites it and the practice is gone with no
error. This is the failure BestPractice already warns about for its own
vendored tree, and it is the single most likely way someone new to this
misuses it.

**So the round trip is:**

1. You say *"make this a team practice."*
2. The session drafts it — Rule, Why, Story, frontmatter — and proposes the
   level with a reason.
3. You approve.
4. **The session writes it to the team's own repo**, on a branch, as a
   proposal — never to the vendored copy in the project you are sitting in.
5. **An approver on that team set says yes**, and it lands on that set's main
   branch. *(If you are the approver, steps 3 to 5 collapse into your one
   "yes" — the session commits it directly. For a small team this is the
   normal case, and there is no waiting at all.)*
6. **Your project's vendored copy picks it up on the next sync**, which the
   background workflow does on a schedule — or immediately, if you ask, so the
   new practice is usable in the session that created it.

**You are never blocked waiting for approval.** If you want the practice in
force right now and someone else has to approve it for the team, put it in
your individual set: it applies to you immediately, with no approval, and
promoting it to the team happens separately. That is the same
narrowest-level-first flow described above, and it means an approval queue
slows down *sharing* a practice, never *using* one.

**If the session cannot reach the team's repo** — no credentials, no network —
it writes the drafted practice to a pending outbox in the project and says so
plainly. It does not write it into the vendored copy as a workaround, because
that is the clobbering trap wearing a helpful face.

### Stage 6 — The Loop Closes

Practices that never fire, are never cited, or whose check never trips become
retirement candidates in the periodic report. This is the half BestPractice
lacks entirely: three creation prompts and no removal prompt at all.

**Retirement is a candidate, never an action — the report proposes, it does
not flip `status: retired` itself.** *(Spelled out 2026-09-02, pre-phase-5;
see [Amendments](#amendments-since-approval).)* Retiring a practice changes
the binding set exactly as much as adding one does, so [the same principle
that governs creation](#what-automatic-honestly-means-here) — the system
notices and proposes, a human approves — applies to removal without
exception, and it routes through **the same per-level approval gate Stage 4
already defines**, not a separate one:

| Level | What retirement requires |
|---|---|
| **Individual** | The owner's own *"yes, retire it"* — identical to individual creation, since there is no one else's approval to seek. |
| **Team** | An approver's review, through the same `approvers.json`/`CODEOWNERS` mechanism Stage 4 uses for a new team practice — never an automatic flip, even when the evidence (never fired, never cited) looks conclusive. |
| **Universal** | A PR to Precedent, same as universal promotion. |

This follows directly from a sentence [Stage 4](#stage-4--approval-by-level)
already states for a different case — *"Adding or removing an approver is
itself a change to the set, so it needs the current approvers' approval"* —
generalized from the approver list to the practice list itself: any change
to what is binding for a set goes through that set's own approval gate,
addition and removal alike. The report is Stage 6's whole job; the decision
stays exactly where Stage 4 already put it.

### What "Automatic" Honestly Means Here

Worth stating plainly, because it is the product's promise and it can be
oversold. **The system automatically notices and proposes; you approve; the
system automatically routes and enforces.** It does not write binding rules on
its own, and it should not.

**The strongest automation is at the enforcement end, not the creation end.**
A practice that becomes a script is automatic forever, at full compliance —
directly evidenced here, where the two script-enforced rules were never
violated while the forty-four prose ones were. So the honest and stronger
version of the pitch is *your team's working habits get captured and then
enforced automatically*, rather than *the AI writes your rules*.

## Migration

### Coexistence

`format_version` in the manifest gates which loader runs, so old and new repos
coexist indefinitely and migrate one at a time. Two starting states:
BestPractice-only, and BestPractice+RPP.

### The Converter

Splitting [PRACTICES.md](process/upstream/PRACTICES.md) into per-practice files is mechanical. Splitting each
practice's prose into Rule / Why / Story is a judgment call, so it is
**LLM-assisted and human-reviewed, once per practice**. Guard against content
drift: **no sentence may appear in the output that does not appear in the
input.** The converter may move and drop text, never invent it. Checkable.

### The Verification Harness

For any repo, before and after migration:

- **Slug-set equality** — the same practices are in effect, by slug.
- **Citation integrity** — every existing citation resolves, including the
  169 by-number `practice N` references and every `#slug` anchor already
  committed in dependent repos.
- **Resident subset** — the post-migration resident set is a strict subset of
  the pre-migration always-loaded set. Nothing newly appears in every session.
- **Reachability** — every on-demand practice has at least one of
  `checked_by`, a narrower-than-`**` `applies_to`, or an `occasion`.
- **Byte-identical regeneration** — every generated view regenerates unchanged
  on a clean tree; a hand-edited view fails.
- **Behavioral replay** — take past commits where a practice demonstrably
  applied and assert the loader would have surfaced it. This is what proves
  the loading model works rather than merely type-checks, and it is the test
  that matters most.
- **Leak gate** — no individual- or team-level term appears anywhere in
  Precedent. RPP's `private-repo-scrub` machinery generalized from words to
  sources, hard-failing rather than warning.

## Sequence

| # | Phase | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Decide and set up.** Take the pending BestPractice update (upstream `88ecf7f`; RPP vendors `c76f06f`). Open the Precedent branch. Agree this plan. | The branch exists on a current base and this document is approved or amended. |
| 1 | **Format, converter, harness.** Write the spec and the verification harness; convert Precedent's catalogue; fix the small tooling debts (freshness escalation, drift re-stamp churn). | Practices are files; the catalogue regenerates byte-identically; harness passes. |
| 2 ✅ | **Loader and generated views.** *(Closed 2026-08-31 — see [What Phase 2 Measured](#what-phase-2-measured).)* Build the loading channels; make [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [MAP.md](MAP.md), [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) and the index generated. **Build the leak gate, pulled forward from phase 3** — see the note under the table. | Resident block within budget; hand-editing a generated view fails a check; the leak gate runs at push time and in CI; **and the premise is measured, not assumed** — see below. |
| 3 ✅ | **Split the sources.** *(Closed 2026-09-01 — see [What Phase 3 Built, and What It Could Not](#what-phase-3-built-and-what-it-could-not).)* Precedent is *already* public (it is BestPractice); Morgan's individual set private; the first team set; the frozen example set. Draft the adopter README. **Write the private-term blocklist into the individual set and point `PRECEDENT_LEAK_BLOCKLIST` at it**, which is what switches the leak gate's vocabulary layer on. **Also split `## Detail` out of `## Rule`** across the catalogue — see the note below the table. | The leak gate's **vocabulary** layer passes (its structural layer already gates every push from phase 2); a consumer repo resolves all three and precedence is tested; `## Rule` is short enough to be worth loading, with the operational specifics in `## Detail`; a README exists that someone outside the project can follow. **All five hold, the fifth (the two private sets populated from RPP's 46 rules) from a session opened directly against `themorgan/precedent-individual` and `themorgan/precedent-team-maintainers` — reported done by Morgan, 2026-09-01, per this plan's own architecture that population can only happen from a session holding those repos, never from here — see the phase-3 section.** |
| 4 ✅ | **Enforcement push.** *(Closed 2026-08-31 — see [What Phase 4 Built, and What It Found First](#what-phase-4-built-and-what-it-found-first).)* *(Swapped ahead of the creation pipeline, 2026-08-31 — see [What Phase 2 Measured](#what-phase-2-measured).)* Convert checkable practices to scripts, starting with the ones phase 2 measured as most-missed; drop their prose from the resident tier; test the graceful-failure paths. | `checked_by` coverage materially above the current 8-of-52; each converted practice has a test proving its check fires; the routing eval re-run shows the converted practices no longer missed. **The first two hold. The third does not, as written, and cannot: this plan's own design says an enforced practice is never routed, so the routing eval cannot show one 'no longer missed'. It is answered by a coverage report that states its own limit. The row's 'drop their prose from the resident tier' was also not followed, for two practices whose check is narrower than their rule. Both departures are argued in the phase-4 section rather than quietly taken.** |
| 5 ✅ | **The creation pipeline.** *(Tooling built and harness-tested 2026-09-02 — see [spec/PHASE5_BRIEF.md](spec/PHASE5_BRIEF.md).)* Candidates, detection signals, promotion criteria, approval routing, the periodic retirement report. | **Met, mechanically: `check_creation_pipeline_fires()` in [tools/verify_harness.py](tools/verify_harness.py) proves a candidate promotes, lands and parses end to end, and that each of the four criteria refuses individually with a reason.** Not yet met in the sense that matters most: no real candidate has been raised against a real incident yet, so the criteria's thresholds are tested for mechanism, not calibration — see [spec/PHASE5_BRIEF.md](spec/PHASE5_BRIEF.md#what-phase-6-inherits). |
| 6 | **Migrate consumer repos**, one at a time, harness-gated. *(Underway, not closed — first real migration run 2026-09-02, see [spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md](spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md).)* | Each repo passes the harness before its migration lands. **One of them does: `themorgan/WorkingWithAI` migrated 2026-09-02, deliberately first as the beta test for the pattern rather than in the order this plan's own text elsewhere suggested (RepoPersonalPreferences, "the one whose failure modes are understood"). That same migration is what drove building `tools/precedent_sync_views.py` (2026-09-03) — the one-command sync a consumer repo actually runs — after finding nothing connected the resolver's output to a generated `AGENTS.md` for a multi-source repo. Not yet met for the rest: no other consumer repo has migrated, so the pattern is proven once, not yet repeated.** |
| 7 | **Merge back to BestPractice.** | A PR is open against `main`, or a deliberate decision to extract the work into a standalone fork instead. |

**Why the leak gate moved from phase 3 to phase 2.** The plan put it at
phase 3 because Precedent was to be a fork, *private initially* — a leak
could be caught and force-pushed away before anyone outside could see it.
[Precedent is now a branch of BestPractice](#amendments-since-approval),
which is public, so **every push is publication, into a repo we do not
own.** There is no grace period and nothing to force-push away. A gate that
first runs when the private sets exist is a gate that arrives after the
exposure it exists to prevent, so it is built now and gates every push from
here on. What phase 3 adds is the *vocabulary* half, described below.

**The gate has two layers, and only one of them can live in this
repository.**

- **Structural**, in [tools/leak_gate.py](tools/leak_gate.py), on from
  phase 2. Precedent holds universal practices and nothing else, so
  anything *shaped* like private-source content fails: an individual- or
  team-level path, a practice claiming a non-universal source, a personal
  email address, an absolute path inside someone's home directory, a
  `candidates/` or `outbox/` directory. These patterns describe shapes
  rather than anyone's words, so they are safe to publish. This layer runs
  in CI ([.github/workflows/leak-gate.yml](.github/workflows/leak-gate.yml)),
  on every branch, where `git push --no-verify` cannot bypass it.
- **Vocabulary**, from phase 3. Catching private *words* — client names,
  code words, internal identifiers — needs a blocklist, and **that list
  cannot live in the repository it protects**: a list of secret terms,
  committed to a public repo, publishes the very terms it guards. So it
  lives in the individual set and `PRECEDENT_LEAK_BLOCKLIST` points at it.
  This is exactly the arrangement practice 15 (`scrub-gate`) already uses —
  blocklist in the private repo, scanning the public vendored tree — and it
  generalizes unchanged.

The consequence, stated plainly rather than left to be discovered: **CI can
only ever run the structural layer**, because CI has no access to a private
list. CI is the unbypassable backstop; the local
[pre-push hook](templates/hooks/pre-push) is the complete check. Neither
alone is the whole gate, and the gate says which layers actually ran rather
than reporting a clean pass it did not earn.

**Why `## Detail` is phase-3 work and not later.** The format now has five
body sections — Rule, Detail, Why, Story, Install — and only the first is
loaded to decide whether a practice applies. Doing the Rule/Detail split at
phase 3 is close to free: the editorial machinery already exists
([tools/resplit_sections.py](tools/resplit_sections.py) plus
[tools/section_split.json](tools/section_split.json)), so the work is one more
pass over a reviewable JSON file rather than 52 hand-edits, and the
content-preservation checks that guard it are already written and adversarially
tested. Doing it *after* phase 6 vendors the format into consumer repos means
migrating every consumer as well. **It is also the only change that actually
delivers this plan's own headline claim**, which measurement has shown the
current four-section split does not.

Two constraints when it happens: `## Rule` must stay loadable on its own —
a session that reads only the Rule must know what to do, not merely that
something applies — and `## Detail` must be reachable from the same
`precedent show` command, not a second one, per
[Loading a Practice Means Loading Its Rule, Not Its File](#loading-a-practice-means-loading-its-rule-not-its-file).

## What Phase 2 Measured

> **Superseded in part, 2026-08-31.** Phase 3's Rule/Detail split changed
> every arm's input — the control loads all 52 Rules, and they are now 28% of
> the catalogue rather than 40% — so the eval was re-run to re-anchor the
> baseline before phase 4. **The numbers in this section describe a catalogue
> that no longer exists.** The direction they establish is unchanged and has
> now held three times; the figures, the miss table and the phase-4 queue
> below are superseded by
> [What the Re-Baseline Changed](#what-the-re-baseline-changed) and by
> [spec/LOADER.md](spec/LOADER.md)'s v3 section. This section is kept because
> the reasoning in it is what the re-run was checked against.

**Phase 2 is closed. Its done-when was "the premise is measured, not
assumed", and the premise is now measured — twice, with the method corrected
between runs. The result went against the plan.** This section is the record
for every session that comes after, because the plan above rests weight on
loading that the measurement will not carry.

### The numbers

[tools/routing_eval.py](tools/routing_eval.py), 20 real commits from this
repo's own history. An **oracle** (all 52 Rules, asked only to classify, one
case at a time — the answer key), a **control** (all 52 Rules, asked to do
the work — the pre-migration arrangement), and a **treatment** (the real
loader: resident block, occasion index, path-triggered channel, in two hops).

| | recall | **miss rate** | practice context | recall per 1k tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Control — all 52 always loaded | 81% | **19%** | ≈11,834 tok/case | 6.8 |
| Treatment — the loader | 62% | **38%** | ≈4,509 tok/case | **13.7** |

Head to head, without the oracle: the control found **15** applicable
practices the treatment missed; the treatment found **3** the control missed.

### The three findings, in order of how much they should change what you do

**1. Triggering misses more than residency.** Measured twice, same direction
both times. On the plan's own terms — *"if triggering does not beat
residency, the plan needs rethinking rather than building on"* — this is the
rethink trigger, and it has fired.

**2. Residency does not reach the goal either, and nobody had ever checked
it.** The control carries the whole catalogue in every session and still
misses 19%. `verify-postcondition` was judged applicable twice and named by
the control **zero** times — while resident, in full, in its context.
`capture-gate`, `environment-gotchas` and `engine-plus-host-shims`:
applicable twice each, found by the control once each. **Both arms miss the
same practices.** The plan's opening evidence (four defects from sessions
carrying the relevant rule) was right, and it generalises further than the
plan assumed: putting a practice in front of a session does not make the
session apply it, at any catalogue size, through any channel.

**3. So the loader is a cost optimisation, not a compliance mechanism.**
That is the honest claim it can carry: **62% less context for 19 points of
recall — twice the recall per token.** Worth keeping, worth finishing, not
worth expecting compliance from. Every claim in this plan that the loader
will recover compliance should be read against this paragraph.

### Where the misses are, and what each kind needs

| missed | caught | practice | reachable via |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | 10 | `cite-the-incident` | occasion prose only |
| 2 | 0 | `capture-gate` | occasion prose only |
| 2 | 0 | `verify-postcondition` | **resident** |
| 2 | 0 | `environment-gotchas` | **resident** |
| 2 | 0 | `engine-plus-host-shims` | occasion prose only |
| 2 | 5 | `convention-to-audit` | occasion prose only |
| 2 | 9 | `mistakes-become-rules` | occasion prose only |

**Every one of these has `checked_by: null`.** That is the single most
actionable fact phase 2 produced, and it is why the Sequence table now puts
the enforcement push at phase 4, ahead of the creation pipeline: a pipeline
that mints more *prose* practices, before enforcement improves, makes the
measured problem worse. It is also the failure this plan opens by
diagnosing — 21 rules to 46 in three days, 2 of 46 enforced.

Two kinds of miss, needing different fixes:

- **Prose-only routing failures.** Everything above except the two resident
  entries is reachable only through the occasion index — no glob, no check.
  All of them are about the *shape of the work* ("a mistake was caught",
  "this is a check-in", "I am about to merge"), which no file path detects
  and which a session does not reliably recognise about itself. 33 of the 46
  on-demand practices are in this position. This is the plan's own named weak
  point, now with a number on it, and it is fixable — with checks, with
  narrower globs, and with the gate-triggered channel that is still unbuilt.
- **Resident misses, which are not a routing problem at all.** No change to
  any loading channel fixes a practice already in front of the session and
  still not applied. This is what `checked_by` and the periodic routing
  audit exist for.

### What NOT to do with this result

**Do not tune the occasion index to chase the recall number.** The resident
misses are the proof that the ceiling is not in the routing layer. Effort
spent there buys less than it appears to.

**Do not re-run the eval before enforcement lands.** Two rounds agree on
direction; a third refines a number that is already actionable. The run worth
doing is the one *after* phase 4, to see whether converting the most-missed
practices to checks moves the miss rate. The harness is committed and
re-runnable (`--emit`, `--emit-hop2`, `--score`), and prints an answer-set
digest so a quoted figure can be traced to the set that produced it.

**Do not read v1's numbers.** The first run scored the treatment at a 52%
miss rate because it gave the arm two of the loader's three channels and
stopped it after one hop. Both were corrected in v2; v1's answers are kept in
`evals/routing/answers-v1/` only so the correction is auditable.

### One honest limit on all of the above

The oracle is a model judgment, not a human answer key, and it shares the
control's context shape — both see all 52 Rules — which may flatter the
control. The oracle-free head-to-head (15 versus 3) points the same way, so
the direction is not an artifact of the key, but the exact gap could be.
A human spot-check of a dozen oracle answers would settle it and has not been
done.

## What Phase 3 Built, and What It Could Not

**Phase 3 is now closed on both sides.** Everything the private sets plug
into exists, is tested, and is documented — and, as of 2026-09-01, the two
private sets themselves have been populated, from a session opened directly
against `themorgan/precedent-individual` and `themorgan/precedent-team-maintainers`
rather than from here, per the structural reason this section originally
explained: no session working in Precedent can hold those repos or write
into them. That reasoning is kept below rather than deleted, since it still
states why the population had to happen from a different session and is not
a gap in how this one was run.

### The done-when conditions, one by one

| Condition | State |
|---|---|
| The leak gate's **vocabulary** layer passes | **Met.** Switched on, and three ways it passed on a leak were found and fixed first (see below). |
| A consumer repo resolves all three sources, and precedence is tested | **Met.** [tools/precedent_resolve.py](tools/precedent_resolve.py); 17 stated cases in the harness, each verified by breaking the resolver. |
| `## Rule` is short enough to be worth loading, with the specifics in `## Detail` | **Met.** Rule is 28% of the catalogue (was 40%); the resident block halved, ≈621 → ≈312 tokens. |
| A README someone outside the project can follow | **Met.** [ADOPTING.md](ADOPTING.md), written to the measured claim rather than the hoped-for one. |
| The frozen example set | **Met** — and invented rather than copied; see [spec/SOURCES.md](spec/SOURCES.md) for why that is the better artifact and not merely the available one. |
| The private sets **populated** from RPP's 46 rules | **Done, 2026-09-01** — from a session opened against the private sets themselves, reported by Morgan; not verifiable from a session working in Precedent, by the same reasoning that made it impossible to do from here. |

### Why the private sets could not be populated from here

Kept as an explanation of why the migration ran from a different session
rather than this one, not as a description of a still-open gap — see the
table above. **As of 2026-09-01, the rule below is relaxed for active
development — [decisions/2026-09-01-relax-private-repo-isolation.md](decisions/2026-09-01-relax-private-repo-isolation.md)
— so a session working on Precedent may now hold and edit these
repositories directly; this section otherwise describes why the historical
migration happened the way it did, unchanged.**

Two independent reasons, both structural rather than circumstantial:

- **A session cannot hold repositories from two owners with push access at
  once.** The two private sets belong to a different account than
  BestPractice. The session that populates them is a session opened against
  *them*.
- **This plan forbids it regardless.** [Risks](#risks): *"Nothing from an
  individual or team set may be staged on this branch at any point, even
  transiently."* Every push here publishes into a public repository owned by
  someone else. Doing the migration "from here" means holding private content
  in this working tree, which is the exposure the whole arrangement exists to
  prevent.

So phase 3 built the receiving half, and the migration that followed had a
resolver, a tested precedence contract, a worked example, and a blocklist
template to work against rather than a blank page. **What that left
unproven going in is stated rather than glossed, and is not re-verifiable
from a session working in Precedent now that the migration has happened
elsewhere:** the precedence contract was tested against fixture practices,
not against RPP's real 46, and a real migration raises allocation
questions — which rules are genuinely generic, which are one person's —
that no fixture can raise. Whether those questions were resolved well is a
fact about the private sets, not about this branch.

### The three ways the leak gate passed on a leak

Recorded here because the gate is the one control standing between a private
word and a publication that cannot be taken back, and because all three were
found by **testing the gate rather than reading it**. Each printed a
confident `leak gate OK` on a push that would have published a blocked term:

- **`--range` used the net `git diff A..B`.** A file added in one commit and
  removed in a later one, in the same push, does not appear in that diff at
  all — and its blob is published regardless, readable forever at the commit
  that added it.
- **The gate then read the working tree.** Having listed the file names out
  of git, it read each name off disk. A term staged and cleaned up
  afterwards, or committed and then reverted, scanned as clean.
- **Commit messages were never scanned.** They are published verbatim, and a
  message is exactly where a session narrates what it was working on.

The gate now walks a range commit by commit, reads blobs out of git, and
scans messages. Two further ways it could look switched on while doing
nothing are closed as well: it **failed open** when
`PRECEDENT_LEAK_BLOCKLIST` was lost (a new shell, a cron job, a cloud
session) — `git config precedent.requireVocabulary true` now makes that
fatal — and a blocklist of nothing but comments reported as configured and
passed with zero patterns.

**Why nothing caught these**, which is the transferable part: the harness's
existing leak-gate check ran the gate on the tree and reported what it said.
That is a check on the *tree*, not on the *gate*, and it passes just as
happily once the gate has stopped looking. The replacement states twelve
cases against a throwaway repository and asserts the exit status. This is the
third time in this project that a check written against the same assumption
as the thing it checked has been green over a real defect.

### The `## Detail` split, and the three practices that refused it

| | phase 1 | phase 1.5 | phase 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `## Rule` share of the catalogue | 44% | 40% | **28%** |
| Practices with `## Rule` over 150 words | 16 | 20 | **7** |
| Resident block | — | ≈621 tokens | **≈312 tokens** |

Fifteen practices gained a Detail. **Five cannot be split at all**, and that
is a finding about the source text rather than a gap in the pass: the
mechanism moves text by reference and the no-invented-content rule forbids it
to write text, so a practice can only be split where its author happened to
leave a seam. `permutation-frontier-column`, `verify-decomposition`,
`mistakes-become-rules`, `scripts-assert-properties` and
`build-buy-decompose` do not have one — in each case, what would remain in
`## Rule` fails the plan's own constraint that a session reading only the
Rule must know what to *do*. Splitting the remaining eight means authoring
new lead-in sentences, reviewed against the source; real work, and not
something a move-only mechanism can do. Per-practice reasoning in
[spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md](spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md).

**Two of those five were found by reading, after the pass reported success.**
The split was made in one pass and then each `## Rule` was read back on its
own, as a session would receive it. Three of seventeen were wrong, and every
check in the harness passed on all three: nothing was lost, invented or
reordered — the judgment was wrong, and the content-preservation net cannot
see judgment. `verify-decomposition` diagnosed a failure mode and prescribed
nothing for it; `scripts-assert-properties` lost the scope gate that says
which scripts to instrument at all; `layered-practice-packs` routed a rule to
*"the pack"* while the sentence defining a practice pack sat in Detail.

The rule that came out of it: **`## Detail` may hold sub-rules and
elaboration, and may not hold anything needed to decide whether, or how
widely, the practice applies.** That is this plan's own definition of Detail
read strictly. One of the three failures has a mechanical signature — a Rule
ending on a colon announces a list it no longer contains — and now has a
check. The other two are judgments about meaning and have none; they needed a
reader, and that is stated rather than left to imply the harness covers it.

**One tension recorded rather than smoothed over.** The split moved
`verify-postcondition`'s two most concrete parts out of the resident Rule.
That practice is the catalogue's most-missed resident one — judged applicable
twice and named by the full-catalogue control zero times — so the change may
make its misses worse. It is correct by this plan's rule, and it is the
single largest contributor to halving the resident block; and
[What Phase 2 Measured](#what-phase-2-measured) is the reason not to guess
either way, since residency produced no measured compliance for this practice
to protect. It carries `checked_by: null` and is on phase 4's starting queue.
Whoever re-runs the routing eval after phase 4 should know this moved
underneath it.

## What the Re-Baseline Changed

Phase 3's Rule/Detail split changed what every arm of the routing eval reads,
so the eval was re-run on the same 20 cases with the same method before phase
4 begins. Full result and method note in
[spec/LOADER.md](spec/LOADER.md)'s v3 section; answers in
[evals/routing/answers/](evals/routing/answers), with the pre-split set kept
beside them.

| | v2 (Rule at 40%) | **v3 (Rule at 28%)** |
|---|---|---|
| Control — recall / miss | 81% / 19% | **84% / 16%** |
| Treatment — recall / miss | 62% / 38% | **69% / 31%** |
| Control — practice context | ≈11,834 tok/case | **≈8,905** |
| Treatment — practice context | ≈4,509 tok/case | **≈4,200** |
| Recall per 1k tokens (control / treatment) | 6.8 / 13.7 | **9.5 / 16.5** |
| Treatment precision | 66% | **81%** |

**Separate what is measured from what is computed.** The cost drop is
computed from the prompts and would come out identically on any re-run: the
control carries **25% less** practice context because the Rules are shorter.
The recall changes — 3 points for the control, 7 for the treatment — are
inside this eval's stated resolution of roughly 15 points on 20 cases. So:
**shortening the Rules cost neither arm any recall and may have gained a
little. It did not measurably improve routing.**

**The direction holds for the third time.** Triggering still misses more than
residency. The gap is now 15 points rather than 19 — which is exactly the
resolution limit, so the magnitude is no longer something this case set can
speak to.

### Two findings that change what phase 4 should do

**1. Phase 2's "both arms miss the same practices" no longer holds for the
resident ones, and the phase-3 split is implicated.**

| practice | v2 control | v2 treatment | v3 control | v3 treatment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `verify-postcondition` | 0 of 2 | 0 of 2 | **3 of 3** | **0 of 3** |
| `environment-gotchas` | 1 of 2 | 0 of 2 | **2 of 2** | **0 of 2** |

This is the risk recorded when the split was made, landing on the practice it
was recorded for. It is three cases and cannot resolve why. **It does not on
its own argue for reverting**, because the reverse prediction is what v2
already refuted: with the long Rule resident, the treatment arm found
`verify-postcondition` zero times out of two as well. No run yet shows
residency working for this practice at any Rule length, which is the argument
for giving it a check.

**2. The phase-4 queue is different, and one entry breaks the framing.**
Re-derived on the same cases: `practice-export-loop` (8 missed / 2 caught) is
now the largest single miss and was not on the old queue at all —
**and it already carries both a narrow `applies_to` and a `checked_by`.** Its
glob fires only on `process/upstream/**` and these cases touch other paths.
So "every most-missed practice carries `checked_by: null`" — the observation
that moved enforcement ahead of the creation pipeline — is no longer true of
the most-missed practice. **Carrying a check does not make a practice
routed**, and phase 4 needs to treat reach and enforcement as two problems
rather than one. `cite-the-incident` (3 missed → 1 of 15) and
`convention-to-audit` (2 → 0 of 7) have left the queue; `capture-gate` was
judged applicable in none of the 20 cases this time and stays a candidate on
v2's evidence rather than this run's.

**Why this run happened when the plan says not to re-run.** The instruction
under [What NOT to do with this result](#what-not-to-do-with-this-result) was
written when the loader's inputs were fixed, and its reason was that a third
run would only refine a direction already measured twice. Phase 3 then changed
those inputs. Re-running *after* phase 4 would have confounded enforcement
with the split, and the pre-phase-4 baseline is recoverable only before phase
4 lands. This is a re-baselining, not a re-measurement of the direction, and
it did not touch the occasion index — which is the tuning that passage
actually forbids.

## What Phase 4 Built, and What It Found First

Implementation note: [spec/ENFORCEMENT.md](spec/ENFORCEMENT.md). Numbers:
[spec/LOADER.md](spec/LOADER.md)'s v4 section.

### The premise that moved this phase forward was half wrong

Phase 2 swapped enforcement ahead of the creation pipeline on the observation
that **every one of the most-missed practices carried `checked_by: null`**.
The re-baseline had already broken half of that (`practice-export-loop` is the
largest miss and carries one). Phase 4 broke the other half, before converting
anything, by running the four scripts the eight existing claims name:

**Seven of the eight were not enforcement at all.** Two named a check that
does not exist or only warns; four named gates that were red on this
repository for reasons unrelated to either practice; one named a scan whose
input list was empty and which therefore printed OK. The eighth,
`doc-references-are-links`, really does gate — on one half of its rule, with
the other half a warning. And none of the eight, that one included, had ever
been watched fire: the harness's only check on a `checked_by` was that the
named *file* is present.

So the phase's real starting number was not 8 of 52. It was one of 52,
partially, and untested — and the first work was re-establishing the eight
rather than adding to them.

### The three done-when conditions

| Condition | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `checked_by` coverage materially above the current 8 of 52 | **Met.** See the generated table in [spec/ENFORCEMENT.md](spec/ENFORCEMENT.md); two false claims were demoted to `null` in the same pass, so the number is smaller than it would have been and means something it did not before. |
| Each converted practice has a test proving its check fires | **Met.** `check_precedent_check_fires` plants a violation per practice in a throwaway repository, requires a non-zero exit, and requires the same tree unplanted to come back clean. The whole registry was then neutered and the harness re-run: it named every one. |
| The routing eval re-run shows the converted practices no longer missed | **Not as written, and the reason is in this document.** See below. |

### Why the third condition cannot mean what it says

This plan states, under [How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load](#how-an-agent-knows-which-practices-to-load), that **enforced practices "are never loaded at all"** — the check's failure message is the rule. A practice with a working check is deliberately outside the routing question. Asking the routing eval to show it "no longer missed" asks the loader to route a practice the design says it should not route.

Phase 4 did two things instead of quietly reinterpreting it:

- **Re-ran the eval on the one input that legitimately changed** — the
  path-triggered channel — and reported the result under this eval's own
  resolution rule. The aggregate treatment gain (69% → 78% recall) is inside
  the noise band and is not claimed. One practice-level effect is real and has
  a mechanism: `practice-export-loop` went from 8 misses to 4 when its glob
  was corrected from where an export *lands* to where the work that triggers
  it happens.
- **Added `routing_eval.py --enforcement`**, which attributes the remaining
  misses to what now covers them, and states its own limit in its output: a
  check in scope means a violation would be caught, not that these commits
  violated anything. **Coverage, not compliance.**

### Reach and enforcement are two problems, confirmed from both ends

The phase-3 brief flagged that carrying a check does not route a practice.
Phase 4 found the converse is equally true and sharper: after the glob fix,
**every remaining `practice-export-loop` miss is a case where the path channel
surfaced it and the session declined it anyway.** Fixing the trigger fixed the
trigger. What is left is judgment, and no glob reaches it.

### One instruction in this plan's own phase-4 row was not followed

*"Drop their prose from the resident tier"* assumes a check is coextensive
with its rule. For `environment-gotchas` the check guards the artifact and
cannot see a discovery that was never written down — which is the failure the
practice is about. For `verify-postcondition` the check asserts two named
postconditions for one repository, while the Rule governs every state-changing
operation. Dropping either would trade a preventive channel for a detective
one that cannot detect the case in question. All six resident practices stay
resident; the reasoning is in [spec/ENFORCEMENT.md](spec/ENFORCEMENT.md).

### The routing pass, and the negative result that closes the reach question

Phase 4's first pass fixed one glob and reported that reach and enforcement
are two problems. Asked to finish the job, it did three things and the third
is the one that matters.

**1. A glob pass over all 46 on-demand practices**, recorded with a reason per
practice in [tools/routing_scope.json](tools/routing_scope.json) — including
for all 24 that deliberately keep `**`, because a practice left unrouted by
omission and one left unrouted on purpose look identical in the practice file.
Eight gained a narrower `applies_to`. The rule the pass settled on, after two
rounds of narrowing: **a glob is justified only where the path identifies the
practice's distinguishing condition, not merely a necessary one.**

**2. The gate-triggered channel**, which is the fourth channel this plan names
and which nothing had built. [tools/precedent_gate.py](tools/precedent_gate.py)
loads the practices registered to a named moment — `merge`, `review`, `push`,
`reply` — via a `gates:` field on each practice. It exists because the most
common reason a practice keeps `**` is that **it fires at a moment, not in a
place**, and no glob reaches a moment. The `push` gate is wired into
[templates/hooks/pre-push](templates/hooks/pre-push) so it fires without
anyone remembering; the other three are cited by runbook steps and the
standing instruction, which is weaker, and phase 6 is where they get hooks.

**3. The eval re-run, against a prediction committed before the change** — and
it is a negative result. Misses went 21 → 22, cost rose 8%, precision fell two
points. **More routing bought no recall.**

What did move is the shape of the miss set: practices the session had never
been shown fell from 13 to 11, and practices it had been shown rose from 8 to
11. **The glob pass converted reach failures into judgment failures without
changing the total** — which is the same thing the `practice-export-loop` fix
showed in v4, now demonstrated across the catalogue rather than on one
practice.

**So the reach question is closed, and the answer is that reach was not the
binding constraint.** Three runs asked it three ways: residency does not
produce compliance (v3); a corrected glob surfaces a practice and the session
declines it anyway (v4); reducing the unshown set does not reduce the miss set
(v5). The routing layer is close to done. Eleven of the 22 remaining misses
are on practices already in front of the session, and fifteen are on practices
that now carry a check.

**The globs were kept anyway, and the reason is worth stating** because it is
not "the number might improve later": a scope statement derived from a
practice's own text is either right or wrong independently of whether twenty
commits from one repository reward it, and the measured structural change —
fewer practices never shown — is the thing a correct glob is for. What is not
claimed is any recall benefit.

*(Full numbers, the prediction and how it held, and the residue no channel
reaches: [spec/LOADER.md](spec/LOADER.md)'s v5 section.)*

### What phase 5 should carry forward

**The cross-source resident budget cap is built (2026-09-01) and has now
been run against the real private sets (2026-09-02).** With all three
repositories attached (per
[decisions/2026-09-01-relax-private-repo-isolation.md](decisions/2026-09-01-relax-private-repo-isolation.md)),
`python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py --repo <a consumer config naming
universal + team> --user-config <a config naming the individual set>`
resolved the real 54 universal + 40 team + 5 individual practices (97
after 2 team/individual overrides replace their universal originals) and
reported: **resident block across all sources: ~659 of 2000 token budget
(10 practices: `bold-key-phrases`, `nonblocking-questions`, `small-calls`
from the team set; `buenos-aires-dates` from the individual set;
`environment-gotchas`, `orientation-map`, `quick-index`,
`reply-links-files`, `repo-is-memory`, `verify-postcondition` from the
universal set)**, exit 0 both plain and `--strict`. Comfortably under
budget — neither private set marked more than a practice or two `tier:
resident`, matching [spec/PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md](spec/PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md)'s
prediction of what would make it fire, and it didn't. This closes
[spec/PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md](spec/PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md)'s "Done when" list
in full. Phase 5's creation pipeline should assume this check exists, is
live, and currently passes with real headroom (~1,341 tokens) — not plan
around building or first-running it.

**A promotion step that accepts a `checked_by` string has re-created the
problem phase 4 spent its first hours undoing.** The creation pipeline should
require a registered check with a firing case, not a field. The harness now
enforces that in both directions — a claim without a case fails, and a case
without a claim fails — so the pipeline can lean on it rather than restate it.

**A tracked audit of the pre-fork catalogue against this plan's own
architecture, table form, one row per practice.** Verdict (active as-is /
rewritten / superseded / merged into a deferred item) plus whether it was a
change Alex needs to hear about. `practice-export-loop` (14),
`mistakes-become-rules` (20) and `layered-practice-packs` (23) are done —
see [CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md](CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md) — the rest of the
catalogue has not had this pass yet, and should before phase 6 migrates a
consumer repo onto practices this plan never checked for collision.

**Team-scoped individual practices — a real case, not a speculative one.**
"One individual set per person, however many teams they belong to" already
holds; what it does not yet cover is a preference that should *differ* by
which team's repo you're working in (an author's name used one way for one
group, another way for a second). The nearest existing idea is the deferred
`in_repos:` filter, generalized to team rather than repo — see the updated
[Deferred](#deferred-speculative--do-not-build-yet) entry. Design the field
and the resolver's conflict rule (two individual practices with overlapping
team scope on one slug fails loudly, same pattern as `overrides`) when phase
5 reaches the private-set schema; don't build it before then.

**Alex's practice 53** (`todo-is-a-handoff`, merged to `main` after this
branch's fork point) has been converted through the same phase-1 pipeline as
the original 52 — see `practices/todo-is-a-handoff.md`. Its `checked_by` is
`null`, considered and declined for now (see the practice's own Install);
revisit when phase 5's enforcement work reaches the TODO backlog. Re-check
`main` for further drift before phase 5 starts in earnest — it had moved 3
commits past the fork point by the time this was caught.


## What Morgan Needs to Do

Only these need a human; everything else a session can do. Phase 0 is
done — both practice-set repos exist, and the license and fork-vs-branch
questions are closed (see
[decisions/2026-08-31-branch-not-fork.md](decisions/2026-08-31-branch-not-fork.md))
— so that checklist is gone from here; what's left is what's still
actually pending.

**Naming convention for practice sets**

```
Precedent                              the engine and universal catalogue
<owner>/precedent-individual           one per person, in that person's account
<owner>/precedent-team-<slug>          one per team
```

- **Precedent carries no prefix** — it is the product, not a set. Everything
  else takes `precedent-`, so practice sets cluster together in a repo listing
  and the engine can find them by pattern rather than configuration.
- **Do not repeat the owner in the name.** The account already namespaces it,
  so `themorgan/precedent-individual` is unambiguous and every person's set has
  the same name in their own account, which keeps tooling simple.
- **Name a team for its purpose, never its roster.** A set called
  `precedent-team-morgan-alex` is stale the moment a third person joins, and
  renaming a repo breaks every vendored reference to it. Slugs are lowercase
  and hyphenated.
- **Practice slugs stay unique across all sources**, since precedence resolves
  by slug — a team practice sharing a universal practice's slug reads as a
  deliberate override, which is a feature only when it is intended.

**Once there is a second team, move the team sets into a GitHub organization.**
An org backs approver lists with real GitHub Teams and stops team repos living
in a personal account when the team is not personal. Not worth doing for one
team; worth knowing before there are five.

**Phase 7**

- **Approach Alex** with the merge-back proposal. A separate document already
  exists for this; it argues the architecture rather than the numbers.

**Ongoing, and the one thing only Morgan can do**

- **Answer the level question** when a session proposes a practice's level. It
  is one word most of the time, but it is the judgment the system cannot make.

## Risks

**Divergence from upstream is the top risk, ahead of the restructure itself.**
Upstream moved during the conversation that produced this document. A
long-lived branch of an actively-changing repo, carrying a structural rewrite,
is the standard way a branch becomes unmergeable by accident. Building on a
branch rather than a fork is itself the strongest mitigation — the work is
merge-clean by construction and shares one history with `main` — but it does
not remove the risk, it only makes it visible earlier. The rest still apply:

- Keep universal practice **text** as close to upstream's wording as possible.
  Confine the change to the format and loading layer, so merge-back is a
  format migration, not a content reconciliation.
- Make the change **additive**: new frontmatter, a new loader, new checks.
  Additive is what turns 80% into 100%.
- Keep a **clean seam between engine and catalogue**, so Alex can take one
  without the other.
- Re-sync with upstream on a schedule, not at the end.

**The premise itself was untested; phase 2 tested it, and it did not hold.**
*(Amended 2026-08-31. The original text is kept below because it states the
bar correctly — it is the bar the result failed. See
[What Phase 2 Measured](#what-phase-2-measured) for the numbers and what
follows from them.)* This plan has
hard evidence that residency does *not* produce compliance — four defects from
sessions carrying the relevant rule in context. It has **no evidence yet that
trigger-based loading does better.** That is an assumption, not a finding, and
it is the assumption everything else rests on. Phase 2 is not done when the
plumbing works; it is done when the loading model has been measured against
real work — replay past commits where a practice applied and check whether the
loader surfaces it, then compare the miss rate against the old always-loaded
arrangement. **If triggering does not beat residency, the plan needs rethinking
rather than building on**, and that is far cheaper to discover at phase 2 than
at phase 6.

**Outcome: triggering did not beat residency** — 38% miss against the
control's 19%, at 62% less context. The rethink this paragraph calls for is
recorded in [What Phase 2 Measured](#what-phase-2-measured); its short form
is that the loader is a cost optimisation rather than a compliance
mechanism, and that the enforcement push moved ahead of the creation
pipeline as a result.

**Personal content leaking into a public repo — and the branch decision made
this sharply worse.** The consequence is permanent and public — hence the
hard-failing leak gate, and individual practices living in a different repo
rather than a different directory.

The original plan bought a margin here that no longer exists: *"Create
`Precedent` as a fork of BestPractice. **Private initially.**"* A private
day-one repo meant the leak gate had a grace period — a leak could be caught
and force-pushed away before anyone outside could see it. **Precedent is now a
branch of a public repo, so there is no grace period: every push is
publication, to a repo whose owner is not us.** Two consequences, both
binding from now on rather than from phase 3:

- **The leak gate must run before every push, not before every merge.** A
  merge-time gate is a gate on the wrong event now. Unchanged by the note
  below -- this keeps running regardless.
- **Nothing from an individual or team set may be staged on this branch at
  any point, even transiently** *(relaxed 2026-09-01 for active
  development -- see below)*. Phase 3's source split has to build the
  private sets in their own private repos and wire Precedent to *resolve*
  them, never to hold them. The plan already says levels are repositories
  rather than directories; this removes the last excuse for a shortcut.

  **Relaxed 2026-09-01, by Morgan's explicit direction, for the duration
  of active pre-Phase-5 development —
  [decisions/2026-09-01-relax-private-repo-isolation.md](decisions/2026-09-01-relax-private-repo-isolation.md).**
  A session working on Precedent may now also hold
  `themorgan/precedent-individual` and `themorgan/precedent-team-maintainers`,
  read and write across all three, and stage their content into this
  working tree — Morgan's own call about Morgan's own content, made
  because there is nothing sensitive in either private set today and the
  "two owners" platform restriction this rule partly rested on was never
  actually confirmed (spec/PRIVATE_SETS_BRIEF.md already flagged that).
  **This must be reinstated before Phase 6 migrates any consumer repo
  other than Morgan's own, and no later than Phase 7** — see the decision
  record for why. The leak gate itself is untouched by this and keeps
  running.

**The loader silently not firing.** Covered above; the reachability and
behavioral-replay checks exist for exactly this.

**Content drift during conversion.** Mitigated by the no-new-sentences rule.

## Precedent Needs a README for People Adopting It

Everything above is written for the people building this. **Precedent also
needs a README written for someone who has never seen it and wants to use it on
their own project** — that document does not exist yet, and it is a deliverable
of this plan, not an afterthought.

It has to answer, in this order, the questions a newcomer actually has:

- **What is this, and why would I want it?** One paragraph, no internal
  vocabulary.
- **How do I add it to a project I already have?** The common case, and the
  one that must be shortest.
- **How do I set up my own personal practices?** One private repo, named by
  convention, declared in the person's own config — and the reassurance that
  nothing personal ever reaches a shared repo.
- **How do I share practices with a team?** Creating a set, naming approvers,
  and what an approval actually looks like day to day.
- **What happens as I work?** The system proposes, you approve, it enforces.
  This is the part that sells it and the part most likely to be written badly.
- **What does it not do?** Worth stating plainly. It does not write binding
  rules on its own, and the human approval in the middle is deliberate.

**Two constraints on how it is written**, both of which this plan's own
vocabulary violates freely because its audience is different:

- **No term the reader does not already have.** Resident tier, occasion index,
  reachability, routing failure — all internal. A newcomer needs *practice*,
  *rule*, *approver*, and very little else. Anything else is either replaced
  with a plain description or glossed on first use.
- **Assume the reader is not a software developer.** Many people using this
  will be working on documents, arguments and decisions. Examples should not
  all be code, and the setup path should not assume comfort with pull requests
  — which is the same open question as the approval interface below.

**Where it lands in the sequence:** draft it during phase 3, when the sources
actually split and there is something real to describe, and treat it as
blocking for phase 6 — no consumer repo should be migrated on the strength of a
document only its authors can follow. It is also the first thing anyone will
judge when Precedent goes public.

**Write it as prose, not as generated output.** The practice catalogue inside
it can be generated; the explanation cannot.

## Open Decisions

- **How a non-developer approves.** The approval flow above assumes a
  team member comfortable with a GitHub review. Many users of this will
  be working on documents and ideas rather than software, and for them
  a pull request is an unfamiliar ritual. The mechanism is right; the
  interface may need to be something else — an approval requested and
  given in a session, with the repo write happening behind it. Worth
  deciding before the first non-technical team is onboarded, not
  before phase 0.

Four decisions once tracked here are closed and moved to
[decisions/](decisions/README.md), which is where a closed decision's full
reasoning belongs: license and attribution (2026-08-31, closed by the
[branch-not-fork](decisions/2026-08-31-branch-not-fork.md) decision itself),
when Precedent goes public (2026-08-31, same decision), the leak gate's
vocabulary-blocklist recalibration
([2026-09-03](decisions/2026-09-03-leak-gate-vocabulary-recalibration.md)),
and the session-trailer key
([2026-09-03](decisions/2026-09-03-session-trailer-key.md)).

## Amendments Since Approval

The header instruction for this document is that changes after approval are
amendments, stated with what changed and why. The body above is kept as
current state; a change that is genuinely a standalone decision (not about
a practice, not merely restating what a section above already says) gets
its own record in [decisions/](decisions/README.md) — this section is now
just a dated index of what moved and where its record actually lives,
matching the rest of this document's own current-state discipline
([docs-are-current-state](practices/docs-are-current-state.md)).

- **2026-09-03 — v31.** [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) and
  [templates/GETTING_STARTED.md](templates/GETTING_STARTED.md) now disclose
  the capture-gate mechanism to newcomers, calibrated to what a clean
  install actually has today. Full reasoning:
  [decisions/2026-09-03-setup-getting-started-disclosure-gap.md](decisions/2026-09-03-setup-getting-started-disclosure-gap.md).
- **2026-09-02 — v30.** Three pre-Stage-5 calls settled: retirement (Stage 6)
  is approval-gated like creation; the attention-ceiling connection is
  reasoned through in [spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md](spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md);
  universal candidates are GitHub Issues, not a `candidates/` file. Full
  reasoning:
  [decisions/2026-09-02-phase-5-preflight-calls.md](decisions/2026-09-02-phase-5-preflight-calls.md).
- **2026-09-01 — v29.** The private-repo isolation rule is relaxed for
  active development. Full reasoning, scope, and the reinstatement trigger:
  [decisions/2026-09-01-relax-private-repo-isolation.md](decisions/2026-09-01-relax-private-repo-isolation.md).
- **2026-09-01 — v28.** Pre-phase-5 review: "deep check" (ambiguous between
  two things) renamed to *routing audit* and *very deep check*;
  `practice-export-loop`, `mistakes-become-rules` and
  `layered-practice-packs` reconciled with the new architecture (see
  [CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md](CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md), opened in this same
  pass); Alex's practice 53 (`todo-is-a-handoff`) converted into the
  catalogue.
- **2026-09-01 — v27.** Phase 3 closed: the private sets are populated —
  see [What Phase 3 Built, and What It Could Not](#what-phase-3-built-and-what-it-could-not).
- **2026-08-31 — v26.** The miss rate is mostly not a loading problem —
  full analysis in [spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md](spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md).
- **2026-08-31 — v25.** The reach question closed with a negative result —
  see [The routing pass, and the negative result that closes the reach
  question](#the-routing-pass-and-the-negative-result-that-closes-the-reach-question).
- **2026-08-31 — v24.** Phase 4 closed — see
  [What Phase 4 Built, and What It Found First](#what-phase-4-built-and-what-it-found-first).
- **2026-08-31.** Precedent is a branch of BestPractice, not a fork; the
  original fork-then-merge-back plan, the "private initially" leak-gate
  margin it assumed, and what this closed and cost: full record in
  [decisions/2026-08-31-branch-not-fork.md](decisions/2026-08-31-branch-not-fork.md).
- **2026-08-31.** The practice file gains a fifth body section, `## Detail`
  — see "The Practice File" above and
  [spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md](spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md).
- **2026-08-31.** Phase 2 closed, premise measured against the plan, and it
  did not hold — see [What Phase 2 Measured](#what-phase-2-measured).
- **2026-08-31.** The leak gate is built at phase 2, not phase 3, a direct
  consequence of the branch decision above. Running it for the first time
  found a live instance of the exact anti-pattern it exists to prevent — a
  hardcoded personal email address inside this public repo, in the
  phase-1 leak-gate stand-in. Fixed forward, not by rewriting published
  history ([no-rewrite-for-warnings](practices/no-rewrite-for-warnings.md)).
- **2026-08-31.** The routing eval re-baselined after the Rule/Detail
  split — see [What the Re-Baseline Changed](#what-the-re-baseline-changed).

### Settled Since Draft v1

- **Name: Precedent.**
- **Ships with an example set** — a one-time frozen copy of Morgan's private
  practices, illustrative only, never updated from the live individual set.
- **Team sets: one repo per team**, for the permissions reason above.
- **A practice belongs to one team**; the multi-team case is speculative and
  deferred.

## Deferred (Speculative — Do Not Build Yet)

- **A practice belonging to more than one team, and a domain bundle shared
  across teams.** Two framings of the same gap, merged 2026-09-01: the
  original case was a single practice claimed by two team repos; the second,
  found auditing `layered-practice-packs` against this plan, is a
  compliance- or lab-workflow domain whose rules several different teams
  would all want, independent of any one team's roster — the case the old
  practice-pack mechanism solved and the loader does not yet replace for the
  cross-team form. Revisit both together when a real case appears.
- **A single consumer repo declaring more than one `team` source, and what
  happens when they disagree.** Distinct from the item above (which is about
  one practice needing to be claimed by two team repositories); this is about one
  repo's own `precedent.json` naming two team sources at once. Same-slug
  collisions between them are already caught loudly today (`resolve()`'s
  `override_claims_by_level` check applies per level regardless of how many
  sources contribute to that level), but two teams' practices that don't
  collide on a slug and still contradict each other in substance are not
  caught at all, and it's not even settled whether declaring two `team`
  sources in one repo is meant to be supported in the first place. Noted
  2026-09-03 during the precedence reorder; explicitly not solved now —
  revisit when a real multi-team-import case appears.
- **Narrowing an individual practice to particular repos, or to a team.**
  An individual set applies wherever its owner works, and `applies_to`
  narrows by path within a repo but not across repos or by which team's
  practices a repo also carries. Two real-shaped variants now: a person
  wanting a practice in their work projects but not their personal ones
  (`in_repos:`), and a preference that should differ by which team's repo
  they're in — e.g. a different name used with different groups — which
  needs the team, not the repo, as the scoping key (`for_team:`). The
  second has a concrete origin (Morgan, 2026-09-01) where the first still
  does not.

  **Designed 2026-09-02, when phase 5 reached the private-set schema, per
  this entry's own instruction — still not built.** Both are the same
  shape, an optional frontmatter field on an *individual* practice only
  (never team or universal, since neither of those needs to narrow by
  which team a repo belongs to):

  ```
  in_repos:  ["owner/repo", ...]   # null (default) = every repo, per the plan's own default
  for_team:  "team-slug"           # null (default) = every team
  ```

  **The resolver's conflict rule, same pattern as `overrides:`.** Two
  individual practices sharing a slug, each scoped by a *disjoint*
  `for_team:` (or `in_repos:`), are not a conflict — that is the whole
  point of the field, one practice per scope. Two sharing a slug where the
  scopes *overlap* (including one narrower and one `null`/wide-open) is a
  conflict the resolver refuses loudly, the same way
  [source precedence](#precedence-and-the-one-case-where-the-individual-does-not-win)
  already refuses an ambiguous `overrides:` rather than picking one
  arbitrarily — a resolver that silently picked the first match on disk
  would make "which one applies here" depend on filesystem iteration
  order, which is exactly the kind of silent, undebuggable behavior this
  whole plan exists to replace with something checkable. `for_team:`
  resolves against whichever team source a consumer repo's own
  `precedent.json` names (a repo not naming that team keeps the
  `for_team: null` variant, if one exists, or gets nothing); `in_repos:`
  resolves against the consuming repo's own identity (`owner/repo`, read
  the same way a git remote is already read elsewhere in this codebase).

  Not built: no real second team exists yet to test the `for_team:` half
  against, and building the resolver change without a real conflicting
  pair to verify it against is exactly the untested-precedence-code gap
  [What Phase 3 Built, and What It Could Not](#what-phase-3-built-and-what-it-could-not)
  already found once, in `precedent_resolve.py` itself, before real private
  sets existed to test against.
- **Per-repo credentials.** Different teams may pay for their own tokens, so
  sync and automation will eventually need per-repo Claude and GitHub
  credentials, failing gracefully and reporting the gap. Real, but not day one.

## Independent of This Plan

Open items from the 2026-08-29 review that this rewrite does not resolve:

- **Header capitalization** in [VOICE.md](VOICE.md),
  [STYLEGUIDE.md](STYLEGUIDE.md) and
  [.github/pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md) still
  differs from the repo's stated convention. Needs a decision either way.
- **An allowlist fix is pending export upstream** — the harness template
  allowlists [practice_audit.py](process/upstream/tools/practice_audit.py) with and without arguments but
  [doc_lint.py](process/upstream/tools/doc_lint.py) only with, so the merge runbook's own bare invocation prompts on every run
  in every repo installing the harness.
