## Rule
When a document presents content that a script computes — a summary
table, a cost rollup, a comparison grid — the document region is wrapped in
invisible sentinels:

    <!--gen:NAME-->
    ...generated markdown...
    <!--/gen:NAME-->

the script gains an `--emit NAME` mode that prints exactly that block, and the
(document, block, script) triple is registered with a small sync tool
(`tools/doc_sync.py`). The bare tool run is a **drift gate** — it fails loudly
when the document's block no longer matches the script's output — and runs with
the repo's other pre-commit gates; `--write` regenerates the blocks in place.
Never hand-edit inside a generated block: the numbers live in the script, the
document is a render target.

## Detail

## Why
Derived numbers quoted in prose silently lag the source that computes
them. Nothing breaks; a human just has to *notice* the staleness — and in one
dependent repo a headline comparison table lagged the scripts behind it until
the repo owner had to ask "did you update the table?". The reminder itself was
the bug: consistency between a computing script and the documents quoting it is
exactly the kind of convention that must become an audit ([convention-to-audit](convention-to-audit.md)), because
it is mechanical to check and embarrassing to miss. The sentinel form matters:
HTML comments render as nothing on hosted markdown, so the plumbing is
invisible to readers, and the block boundaries make regeneration deterministic
(no fuzzy matching against drifting prose).

## Story

## Install
Copy `tools/doc_sync.py`; register pairs in its `PAIRS` list; wrap
the generated regions; give each computing script an `--emit` mode. Wire the
bare run into the same "run before committing" list as the other gates. Start
with whichever document has already bitten you — the one someone had to be
reminded to update.

Two extensions the tool enforces once pairs exist. **The provenance footer:**
every registered document ends with a `**Numbers by:**` footer naming each
script that feeds it (the tool fails on a missing footer or an unnamed
script) — so a reader of the rendered page always knows which code produced
the numbers, without opening the sync tool's registry. **Composition:** an
emitting script may import other computing scripts and re-emit their numbers
in a new arrangement (a per-product sheet drawing on several models); the
sync gate then flags every downstream document when any upstream script
changes — the dependency graph rides the registry for free.

A third extension for documents that absorb concurrent merges. The sync
gate protects only the *generated* regions: a prose section can vanish in a
three-way merge and nothing turns red — and in one dependent repo the owner
asked whether a heavily-merged document had lost a major section (it had
not, but only a manual full-history scan of its section headers could prove
it). Where a document accumulates sections across concurrent branches, keep
a **required-sections list** beside the computing script's self-assertions —
a check that fails when a listed header is absent from the document. A
deliberate rename or removal updates the list in the same change; an
accidental merge-loss fails the build. The retroactive form of the same
check — every section header any commit ever added, compared against the
current document — answers "did we already lose something?" once, when the
suspicion first arises; the list encodes it forward.
