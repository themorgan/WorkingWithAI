# The Practice Simulation (Brief)

**Status: approved; phases 1-4 (rough phasing, below) are built.** Written up
per Morgan's request to have a plan to approve before implementation starts.
Treat this the way `spec/PHASE5_BRIEF.md` and friends were treated
— a brief a phase is built from, updated in place as it's actually built,
never left to drift out of sync with a second, separate copy.

## Never automatic

**No keyword, phrase, or occasion-index entry triggers any of this.** All
three tools this brief has produced —
[`tools/behavioral_replay.py`](../tools/behavioral_replay.py)'s
`--with-checks`, [`tools/practice_simulation.py`](../tools/practice_simulation.py),
and [`tools/precedent_simulate.py`](../tools/precedent_simulate.py) — are
plain command-line scripts. Nothing in `practices/*.md`'s `occasion`
fields, `AGENTS.md`'s generated loader block, `tools/precedent_gate.py`'s
named moments, or any git/session-start hook mentions any of them — this
is a checked fact, not an intention (`grep -rn "behavioral_replay\|
practice_simulation\|precedent_simulate" practices/ tools/precedent_gate.py
.claude/` returns nothing). They run only when a person runs them directly,
or explicitly asks an agent session to run them in that turn. That must
hold for every future phase too: none of these tools is ever to be added
to a hook, a gate, an `occasion` clause, or a session-start script. A
session encountering `spec/SIMULATION_BRIEF.md` while working on something
else has no standing
to run any of these tools on its own initiative from that alone.

## The question this exists to answer

Morgan wants a command — eventually reachable the way `precedent show` and
`precedent gate` are — that reports something like *"of the practices that
should have fired, how many did; of the ones that fired, how many produced
a correct result"* — and that he can run **regularly** to track whether
routing is getting better or worse over time.

## Why the existing tools don't already answer it

- [tools/behavioral_replay.py](../tools/behavioral_replay.py) is cheap and
  mechanical but only covers the ~23 practices with a real `applies_to`
  glob, and never asks whether guidance was *followed* — only whether it
  would have been *shown*.
- [tools/routing_eval.py](../tools/routing_eval.py) already measures both
  recall and (loosely) correctness, oracle/control/treatment, but it
  replays a fixed set of 20 historical commits from this repo's own past.
  That's the design flaw this brief exists to fix: a fixed replay set is
  something the loader's own inputs get tuned against — the v5 round in
  [the phase-2 loader spec](LOADER.md) already shows a glob pass "converting reach
  failures into judgment failures" on the *same* 20 cases. Optimizing a
  design against the thing that scores it is Goodhart's law, not
  validation. It also can't say anything about how routing behaves on a
  dependent repo's own file layout, conventions, or source precedence —
  it has only ever run against this repo.

## Design

### 1. Generate scenarios, don't replay them

For each practice's `occasion` (or, for path-triggered ones, its
`applies_to` scope), a generator persona invents a plausible, fictional
task that should trigger it — not a summary of a real commit, an
independently authored situation. This decouples the test set from any
fixed history and means a fresh batch can be produced every run instead of
scoring the same cases repeatedly.

### 2. Negative and near-miss cases, deliberately

For every real scenario, also generate: (a) a distractor that sounds
similar but shouldn't trigger the practice, and (b) cases straddling two
confusable practices (e.g. `convention-to-audit` vs. `mistakes-become-rules`
— both about a violated rule, different triggers). Real history rarely
hands you clean confusable pairs on demand; synthesis can manufacture
exactly the boundary the routing design needs to prove it can hold.

### 3. Adversarial generation

Rather than a single generator producing "the obvious example," a separate
pass asks a generator to invent the case *most likely to fool the router*
for a given practice — surface cues pointing elsewhere, or an easy-to-miss
framing. This targets the design's weak points instead of its average
case, which is what a benchmark you intend to trust needs.

### 4. Rotate the set; never let it become a fixed benchmark

Each run reseeds scenarios (different fictional domain, different
phrasing) rather than reusing a saved case bank. Improving the score then
requires improving the actual routing logic — the occasion index wording,
the globs, the resident set — not hand-tuning against twenty known
answers. This is also what makes "run it regularly" mean something: a
trend line across rotating batches, not a number that stops moving once
it's been fit once.

### 5. Score correctness two ways, and say which is which

- **Mechanical, where a proven `checked_by` exists.** For the ~26 checked
  practices (and only the ones `check_precedent_check_fires` actually
  verifies fire in both directions — see the `checked_by` explanation
  above), have the agent under test actually perform the synthetic task
  and run the real check script against its output. Objective, free of
  grader bias, no large language model (LLM) judgment involved.
- **Judged, for everything else.** The remaining prose-only practices need
  an LLM verdict on whether the produced work actually satisfies the
  Rule. Report this separately from the mechanical score rather than
  blending them into one number — they have very different reliability,
  and blending them would hide which one moved.

### 6. Test against attached repos, not only this one

This is the part current tooling has never done at all. Routing is
repo-shaped: a glob like `templates/**` means "where this repo keeps
practice text" here and "the host's own files" in a dependent repo (this
exact gap is already called out in
[spec/ENFORCEMENT.md](ENFORCEMENT.md)'s `practice-export-loop` section).
A simulation that only ever runs against BestPractice's own tree cannot
tell us whether routing holds up anywhere else, and the cross-source
resolver ([spec/SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md)'s precedence, universal + team +
individual + repo-local) has only been tested against one synthetic
fixture, never a real consumer repo with real content.

So: for each repo attached to a simulation run —

- Generate scenarios using **that repo's actual file tree and
  conventions** (real paths, real naming, real language/stack), not
  BestPractice's own — so path-glob matching is exercised against layouts
  it wasn't written against.
- Materialize that repo's actual resolved practice set (universal + its
  own team/individual/repo-local sources, via the same
  `precedent_materialize.py` / `precedent_sync_views.py` path a real
  install uses) rather than assuming BestPractice's catalogue applies
  as-is.
- Score routing **and** precedence together: does a repo-local override
  actually take priority over the universal practice it overrides, in a
  scenario built to exercise that.
- Report **per repo**, not only as one rolled-up average — a regression
  on one dependent repo's routing shouldn't be invisible inside a mean
  across several.
- Scenario generation still follows the "don't replay history" rule from
  §1 — a dependent repo's own past commits are as susceptible to
  overfitting as this repo's are. The repo's tree and conventions are the
  input; its git log is not the source of the test cases.

This needs a maintained list of attached repos to run against (repos this
session or a future one has `add_repo`'d, or a small fixture list of real
dependent repos that have opted in) — an open question in the phasing
section below, not decided here.

### 7. Cadence — two tiers, not one command pretending to be both

- **Light / frequent.** Mechanical-only: `behavioral_replay.py`'s existing
  reach measurement, plus the new mechanical correctness scoring from §5,
  against this repo. Free, fast, safe to run on every push or as a
  standing `precedent simulate --quick` command.
- **Full / periodic.** The synthetic generation + negatives + adversarial
  hardening + judged scoring + attached-repo pass from §1-6. Costs real
  LLM calls, run weekly or monthly (or on demand) rather than per-push —
  `precedent simulate` with no flag, or `precedent simulate --full`.

Both report into one running log (a generated block, following
`docs-track-models` — figures live in a script's output, not retyped into
prose) so the trend is visible over time, the way `spec/LOADER.md`
currently narrates routing-eval rounds by hand.

## What this keeps from existing infrastructure vs. what's new

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| Mechanical path-glob replay | Kept — `behavioral_replay.py`'s reach measurement, unchanged, folded into the light tier |
| Oracle/control/treatment three-arm structure | Kept as the shape, but driven by generated scenarios instead of a fixed 20-commit set |
| Isolation between hops (no repository access, so the index can't be sidestepped) | Kept from `routing_eval.py` |
| `checked_by` mechanical scoring | New — routing_eval today judges applicability, never runs a real check against the output |
| Synthetic generation, negatives, adversarial cases, rotation | New |
| Multi-repo testing | New |
| Two-tier cadence with a running trend log | New |

## Open questions (for you, not decided here)

- Which repos count as "attached" for §6 by default — anything the session
  has added this run, or a maintained opt-in list? Real dependent repos
  vary in how much they want a simulation harness poking at their tree.
- Budget for the full tier — how many synthetic scenarios per run is
  worth the LLM cost, and does that scale per attached repo or stay fixed
  regardless of how many are attached?
- Where the "generator" and "judge" roles should be different
  models/personas to reduce the risk of one session's blind spots
  producing both the test and its own passing grade.

## Rough phasing

1. **Built.** Mechanical correctness scoring against proven `checked_by`
   checks, folded into `behavioral_replay.py` as `--with-checks`
   (`--max-correctness-commits N` bounds it, default 25 — each sampled
   commit is checked out into a scratch git worktree and run through
   *that commit's own* `tools/precedent_check.py`, since older commits
   predate some checks entirely). Trusts only the slugs
   `verify_harness.py`'s `check_precedent_check_fires` actually proves
   fire both ways (read from its own `case(...)` registrations, not
   hand-copied, so this can't silently drift) — 26 as of this writing —
   and only in `tree`/`change` scope (`turn-end` checks are about live
   session state, never exercised by a historical `--range` replay, and
   would misreport as a false 100% pass rate if counted). A first run
   against this repo's own history found 3 real, live violations
   (`acronyms-glossary` ×2, `docs-are-current-state` ×1,
   `index-remembers-past` ×1, across 5 violated data points total — one
   commit tripped two checks at once) out of 459 (commit, check) data
   points sampled on a later, larger run — genuine signal, not a smoke
   test, and all 3 were fixed in the same session that found them (a
   version-control annotation removed, two acronyms expanded, one
   accidental "superseded by" phrase reworded) and reverified clean
   against both the specific commits and the whole tree before landing.
   Deliberately narrow: this measures retrospective enforcement
   compliance for the ~26 checked practices only, nothing about the other
   ~31, and nothing about routing or intent.
2. **Built.** Synthetic scenario generation, as `tools/practice_simulation.py`
   (`new-batch` / `route` / `score`), against this repo only — replacing
   `routing_eval.py`'s fixed case set with practices sampled fresh each
   batch (no fixed default seed; rotation is the point) and three
   invented scenarios per practice (positive / negative / adversarial,
   §1-4), each naming plausible file paths so the actual path-triggered
   channel (`tools/precedent_paths.py`) is exercised mechanically, not
   simulated. Single-hop treatment only for this v1 (the "cheapest
   version" `spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md` already validates as legitimate,
   not an ad hoc cut) — reads the real generated loader block straight out
   of `AGENTS.md`, never a re-derivation of it. Scoring reports plain-case
   recall, negative-case correct-rejection, and adversarial-case recall
   *separately*, plus the plain-vs-adversarial gap — the number a fixed
   replay set structurally cannot show. Validated end to end on a real
   3-practice batch (`20260904T143422Z-seed745016`, kept under
   `evals/simulation/` as the record): 3/3 plain, 3/3 negative, 3/3
   adversarial, all correct — a genuinely tiny sample (n=3) that proves
   the mechanism runs correctly, not that routing is flawless; a real
   read on routing quality needs several batches at a larger `--count`.
   **Deferred, stated plainly:** the treatment agent does not yet perform
   the synthetic task and have a real `checked_by` script run against its
   output (extending phase 1's mechanical-correctness idea to synthetic
   work) — that needs a real sandboxed workspace for it to edit files in,
   which this file-based prompt/answer handoff does not provide. Real,
   separate follow-on work, not silently folded into the score above.
3. **Built.** Multi-repo pass (§6): `new-batch` and `route` accept
   `--repo-root PATH`, pointing every step at a different repo's own
   materialized practice set and generated loader block instead of this
   repo's. No real dependent repo was attached to the session that built
   this, so `build-fixture-repo` constructs an honestly-labeled FIXTURE
   consumer repo at `evals/simulation/fixtures/demo-consumer-repo/` (its
   own fictional Flask-style file tree, one repo-local override of
   `engine-plus-host-shims` narrowed to that fixture's own vendored path)
   through the real `tools/precedent_sync_views.py` /
   `tools/precedent_materialize.py` pipeline this repo already ships and
   tests — never a re-implementation of source resolution. Validated end
   to end: the override provably wins precedence (the materialized set
   drops `engine-plus-host-shims` entirely; only the override's slug
   reaches the fixture's own loader block), the real path-triggered
   channel fires the override on a scenario touching its narrowed path
   and correctly does NOT fire it on a path the narrowing excludes, and
   all 3 invented scenarios (plain/negative/adversarial) routed correctly
   against the fixture's own materialized loader block. Scoring reports
   per repo, never pooled across repos or with a same-repo batch — see
   the score output for why. A real dependent repo works identically:
   attach it and point `--repo-root` at its checkout once it has its own
   `precedent.json` and a synced `AGENTS.md`.
4. **Built.** `tools/precedent_simulate.py`, one front door over both
   tiers, plus `evals/simulation/trend.jsonl` — a run's worth of numbers
   appended, never overwritten or averaged into a restated figure. `quick`
   runs `behavioral_replay.py --with-checks` start to finish in one
   command (no LLM calls) and logs reach %, context reduction, and
   mechanical-correctness clean/violated/errored counts. The full tier's
   generate/route steps still need a person or an explicitly-asked agent
   in the loop — that cannot be, and must not be, wired into one
   synchronous command (see "Never automatic" above) — so `record --batch
   ID` closes the loop instead: once a batch is fully scored, it reads
   `practice_simulation.score_batch()`'s real result (never a second
   computation of the same arithmetic) and logs it. Refuses to log a
   batch with any unanswered scenario, so a partial run can't misreport
   as a small, misleadingly clean one. `trend` reads the log back, split
   by tier and, within the full tier, by repo — a quick-tier run, a
   this-repo batch, and a different-repo batch are three different
   measurements and pooling them would misstate all three (sections 6-7).
   Validated end to end: a real `quick` run (`OK`, 100% reach on the
   60-commit sample, 287/290 mechanical-correctness data points clean),
   both phase-2/3 batches recorded via `record`, and `trend` printed all
   three back correctly grouped. Also verified `record` actually refuses
   an unscored batch rather than logging a hollow result.
