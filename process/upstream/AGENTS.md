# Repository notes for agents

<!-- These are the instructions for sessions working ON the BestPractice
     repo itself (the upstream). Inside a dependent repo's vendored copy
     (process/upstream/AGENTS.md) this file is inert — the dependent repo
     has its own instantiated AGENTS.md at ITS root. -->

**TEMPORARY, read before opening or merging any pull request (PR) here:
every PR in this repository targets `precedent-beta-v01`, never `main`, until Alex reviews
and merges `precedent-beta-v01` into `main` for real — a deliberate,
phase-7 act, not something any routine PR does incidentally. Merging a PR
into `precedent-beta-v01` needs no sign-off from Alex — once its deep
check passes, a session may merge it directly; that branch is where
routine work lands, not a gate he sits behind. Alex's approval is reserved
for `main`, and specifically for merges carrying major changes onto it —
the phase-7 fold-in is the paradigm case, but any other merge reaching
`main` with a non-trivial change needs the same explicit, named go-ahead.
A general "PR and merge it" authorization, with no branch named, still
means `precedent-beta-v01`; merging into `main` requires Alex naming
`main` explicitly, in that specific request. Check the base branch
explicitly before acting — do not assume `main` just because it is the
repository's configured default branch, and do not assume the two
branches are interchangeable even when they happen to sit at the same
commit, which is exactly the condition under which this rule's own
origin incident happened. Full story, the mechanical check, and the
retirement condition:
[local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md](local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md).**

**This repo's standing merge-authorization keyword is "Go merge"** —
standing alone (its own line, or set off by a preceding sentence-ending
punctuation mark; case-insensitive), it means: commit and push what the
thread just agreed on to `precedent-beta-v01`, per the paragraph above,
after the usual checks, without asking again — and then fetch and confirm
local `HEAD` and `origin/precedent-beta-v01` actually match before calling
it done ([verify-postcondition](practices/verify-postcondition.md)). See
[practices/merge-authorization-keyword.md](practices/merge-authorization-keyword.md)
for the full rule and what does *not* count as standing alone.

**This repo is becoming Precedent, a restructuring of BestPractice — read
[PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md](PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md) first, in full, before
touching anything else here.** It is the approved plan of record; its "For
the Session Implementing This" section says how to work from it (phase by
phase, in order — do not read the whole plan trying to hold it all in
context at once; work from the phase you are on).
[spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md](spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md) documents the phase-1
practice-file format this repo's `practices/*.md` files are written in,
including where the actual conversion had to make a call the plan's own
illustrative example left open. [spec/LOADER.md](spec/LOADER.md) documents
phase 2's loader: what got built, the resident-set curation and why, and
what the behavioral-replay measurement does and does not prove about the
plan's premise.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: precedent-loader -->

<!-- Regenerate with: python3 tools/build_views.py -- do not hand-edit this block, tools/verify_harness.py's regeneration check fails on drift. -->

### Resident block (~312 of 2000 token budget, 6 of 61 practices)

**environment-gotchas.** Every expensive environment discovery (a package that must be
installed, a tool that silently doesn't work, a path that does work) is
written into a "do NOT rediscover these" section — with the story of what
failed and why, not just the fix.

**orientation-map.** A top-level `MAP.md` indexes the repo: what the key deliverables
are, where everything lives, and — crucially — which supporting documents back
each part of each deliverable. Every session reads it before doing anything.

**quick-index.** The project instructions file carries a "check here BEFORE searching
the repo" table: *looking for X → go to Y*, one row per thing sessions
actually hunt for.

**reply-links-files.** A session's reply that created or modified files ends with a
"Files touched" list: each entry links the file on the working branch *and*
its post-merge location, with a one-line description. The reader must be able
to open the work from the chat, not merely learn it exists.

**repo-is-memory.** Everything a future session needs — orientation, open items,
decisions, lessons — lives in committed files. A session's chat thread is
disposable; if knowledge exists only in a thread, it is already lost.

**verify-postcondition.** After any state-changing operation, check **the state you wanted**,
not that the command reported success. Name the postcondition before you run
the command — *"no unpushed commits on any branch"*, *"the gate passed"*,
*"the file contains X"* — and then test that, independently of whatever the
command printed.

### Occasion index

```
When a change here has implications for how an attached team, individual, or repo-local source should work:
  cross-source-rollout — roll it out to attached sources now; else a blocked-on TODO
When a change must propagate across several parallel artifacts:
  parallel-artifact-ledger — ledger the transfer verdict per member, per change
When a computation books a transfer between two parties:
  name-both-sides-of-ledger — name both sides; check what is charged against what is received
When a convention is violated for the first time:
  convention-to-audit — promote a costly broken convention to a script that exits non-zero
When a document presents a script-derived figure:
  docs-track-models — every script-derived figure sits inside a generated block
When a document replaces or is replaced by an earlier one:
  index-remembers-past — put the lineage in the index, not in either document
When a person explicitly asks for a "very deep check" across the whole repo, or after work that invites drift:
  very-deep-check — read the whole repo against itself for drift; never a routine gate
When a person explicitly asks for a full practice audit (or "practice check") across the whole catalogue:
  full-practice-audit — sweep every source's full catalogue, one practice at a time, on request only
When a practice lands or a candidate is raised, at any level:
  disclose-landing — state plainly what happened and where — individual, named team, or universal
When a review finds a defect:
  mistakes-become-rules — root-cause the miss, then encode the prevention
When a tool warns about already-published git history:
  no-rewrite-for-warnings — fix the setting forward; never rewrite published history
When an install step adds something GitHub-specific:
  github-setup-disclosed — disclose GitHub-specific setup where the project's people read
When building a mechanism that makes something discoverable or reachable:
  affordance-is-shared — name who else the mechanism you just built now serves
When building a permutation or configuration-sweep table:
  permutation-frontier-column — one full table with a computed Frontier column
When building a variant of an existing thing:
  variant-re-derives — re-derive what a variant inherits; limits bind, choices do not
When building or committing a generated artifact:
  generated-artifact-provenance — stamp a build code and a manifest; never hand-edit output
When checking whether the practices that should have fired for recent work actually fired:
  routing-audit — run the mechanical coverage check now; roll the deep-read slice forward
When committing anything that touches the vendored/public tree:
  scrub-gate — the public tree is public-safe at all times, not just at check-in
When comparing an option against a baseline:
  check-source-architecture — check both options exist in the source before costing them
When deciding where a new rule belongs:
  layered-practice-packs — generic, domain, repo-local — each rule to its own layer
When deciding whether to build or buy a component:
  build-buy-decompose — decompose first; one verdict per part, on ownership grounds
When exporting a tool across a repo boundary:
  engine-plus-host-shims — one vendored engine, thin host shims, never a fork
When finishing a substantial work-product, before the merge-time capture gate:
  second-pass-capture — a separate capture pass after the work, not inside it
When merging a branch:
  capture-gate — capture the follow-on work in the thread that created the need
When merging a branch that improved a generic practice:
  practice-export-loop — vendor upstream as tracked files; check improvements back in
When merging a branch that touches shared files:
  merge-runbook — write conflict resolution per file class, once, then follow it
When migrating a repo off an old practice system onto Precedent:
  migration-scrubs-vocabulary — scrub the old system's vocabulary the same session, not on request
When naming a new file:
  no-version-suffix — name a file for what it is; the repository is the version
When naming what "run the checks" means in a repo:
  two-check-levels — name a fast check and a full check; say which gates what
When ordering sections in a document:
  section-order-by-frequency — order sections by how often the reader needs them
When printing a numeric quantity that will be compared across rows:
  one-formatter-per-quantity — one formatter per quantity kind, declared in one module
When publishing a document with a multi-column sortable table:
  tabular-shared-renderer — ship a sortable render from the one shared renderer
When quoting or compressing someone else's figures:
  quote-discipline — compression rounds against you; qualifiers travel with the figure
When reporting a computed total or a negative feasibility result:
  verify-decomposition — check the parts, not the total; never assert an impossibility
When setting up a new repo's session start:
  session-bootstrap — setup lives in a session-start hook, not in memory
When starting an outward-facing deliverable:
  frame-from-audience-question — build it around the audience's question, not your material
When starting work the repository may already cover:
  search-by-purpose — search by purpose and by mechanism before concluding nothing exists
When the user gives a standing merge instruction:
  merge-authorization-keyword — one fixed word means "merge as agreed"; document it exactly
When tracking state that multiple documents need to agree on:
  registry-source-of-truth — state lives in one machine-readable registry; documents derive
When writing a README or other project-facing entry document:
  lead-with-what-it-is — say what the project is before how it is maintained
When writing a document that cites a computed number:
  computed-numbers-in-scripts — computed content lives in a sync-gated generated block
When writing a new convention or rule:
  checkable-gets-checked — attempt a mechanical check before leaving a new practice advisory-only
  cite-the-incident — record the failure a rule prevents, inline with the rule
When writing a reader-facing deliverable with supporting apparatus:
  deliverables-look-like-output — the deliverable holds only what its audience needs
When writing a rule that depends on the outside world:
  volatile-rules-carry-dates — a rule about the outside world carries its date, inline
When writing a script whose numbers a document will cite:
  scripts-assert-properties — scripts assert their own properties and their cited anchors
When writing an outward-facing document:
  readers-vocabulary — use the reader's words; gloss inline or replace
When writing an outward-facing summary of claims:
  outward-summary-discipline — claims-to-source table, honest sums, a recorded adversarial pass
When writing code because a specific practice requires it:
  code-cites-practice — cite the practice's slug in a comment, right where the code is
When writing or editing a document:
  acronyms-glossary — expand acronyms on first use; keep one central glossary
  doc-references-are-links — reference repo files as relative links; use ≈, never ~
  docs-are-current-state — state what is true now; version control holds the history
  label-describes-content — "one line" must be one line; else name it for its content
When writing or filling out a pull-request description:
  pr-template-honest-gates — write the body from the diff; an unchecked box is fine
When writing or triaging an open item:
  todo-is-a-handoff — queue only for a stated blocked-on/out-of-scope reason — otherwise just do it
```

### Standing instruction

Before starting work of a kind named in the occasion index above, run `python3 tools/precedent_show.py SLUG` for each listed slug to load its Rule. When editing a file, `python3 tools/precedent_paths.py FILE` prints any on-demand practice whose `applies_to` matches it, without needing the index at all. At a named moment — merging, reviewing, pushing, ending a turn — run `python3 tools/precedent_gate.py merge|review|push|reply`: some practices fire at a moment rather than in a file, and no path glob reaches those.

The rest of this file (below) is BestPractice's own pre-fork orientation —
still accurate for `PRACTICES.md`, `INSTALL.md`, and the rest of the
inherited tree, which the plan has not restructured yet. It will be rewritten
in place as later phases land (the plan's own generated-views work, phase 2)
rather than kept as a second, drifting copy.

---

**Orientation: read [README.md](README.md) first.** This repo is
BestPractice itself — the upstream practice layer that dependent repos
vendor. Practices you follow here are the ones this repo teaches; a session
that skips them in this repo of all places is the joke writing itself.

## Build-environment gotchas — do NOT rediscover these

Each entry carries what failed, not only the fix — the fix alone is a fact
you cannot judge, and the next session re-derives it the moment it looks
wrong. [tools/precedent_check.py](tools/precedent_check.py) gates this
section: an entry with no failure attached fails `--only environment-gotchas`.

- **`pip install cmarkgfm`, or [tools/doc_lint.py](tools/doc_lint.py)'s
  strikethrough check silently stops running.** Without it the check does not
  fail — it prints a one-line notice and scans for everything else, so a
  document that renders an unintended `<del>` on GitHub passes the gate.
  [.claude/hooks/session-start.sh](.claude/hooks/session-start.sh) installs
  it, but only when `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`; a local shell has to do it.

- **A git helper that returns stdout and drops the exit code will hand you a
  ref *name* where a commit hash belongs.** `git rev-parse <missing-ref>` exits
  non-zero but *prints the ref you asked for* on stdout, so
  `_git(...'rev-parse', ref) or <fallback>` never falls back: it binds the
  truthy string `origin/precedent-beta-v01` and carries it forward as a hash.
  Reached continuous integration on 2026-09-06 as `precedent-beta-v01 @ origin/prece has no
  tools/build_views.py` — a 12-char truncation of a ref name. Use
  `rev-parse --verify --quiet` (silent, exit 1) whenever a ref may be absent.
  Note the trigger: a *non-repo* prints nothing, so the plain form looks fine
  for years — it only echoes on an **unborn `HEAD`** (a repo with no commits) or
  a missing ref, which is why this survived so long. Audited across
  [tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py](tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py) on
  2026-09-06 and found twice more: `status()` reported a clone that simply has
  no `SOURCE_BRANCH` as *"upstream has moved — run `refresh`"*, a false alarm
  wired to what was then a destructive remedy; and `seed()` recorded
  `source_commit: "HEAD"` into `ENGINE_MANIFEST.json`, after which every later
  comparison read as "moved" forever. A sweep found the same one-liner in
  [tools/routing_audit.py](tools/routing_audit.py), where it was persisting a
  review record at commit `"HEAD"`.
  The same swallowed exit code hid a failing `git checkout` in a dirty tree
  during the very session that fixed this, making a broken negative control
  look like a passing test — so treat "the command reported nothing" as no
  evidence at all.

- **A stale container is indistinguishable from missing work, and the
  freshness guard can be the thing that's lying.** On 2026-09-06 a session
  started on a 5-day-old shallow clone, 207 commits behind
  `precedent-beta-v01`, and concluded that
  [tools/precedent_check.py](tools/precedent_check.py) and
  [.github/workflows/deep-check.yml](.github/workflows/deep-check.yml) "did
  not exist" — they had landed days earlier.
  [.claude/hooks/session-start.sh](.claude/hooks/session-start.sh) stayed
  silent because its `git fetch` failed and it then compared the local commit
  against an unrefreshed remote-tracking ref: both were equally old, so nothing looked
  behind. Fixed to warn when the fetch itself fails. Before concluding that
  anything is missing or unfinished, run `git fetch origin <branch>` and
  `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/<branch>`.

- **This repo is normally cloned `--depth 1`, and several tools degrade
  rather than fail on that.** [tools/behavioral_replay.py](tools/behavioral_replay.py)
  divided by the replayable-commit count and took the whole harness down with
  a `ZeroDivisionError` on a one-commit clone — the exact environment a fresh
  session starts in. It now reports `REPLAY_STATUS: DEGRADED` instead. On the
  same clone `origin/main` does not exist, so doc_lint's changed-vs-default-branch
  scope quietly becomes changed-vs-`HEAD`: it checks your uncommitted files
  and nothing else. Fix both with a bounded
  `git fetch --depth=500 origin <branch>`; some git policy hooks block
  `--unshallow`, and a bounded fetch works either way.

- **`git clone --depth 1 /some/path` is ignored; git only honours `--depth`
  over a transport.** A phase-2 smoke test believed it was exercising a
  shallow clone for an hour and was not — the bug it was written to catch was
  still there. Use `file:///some/path` to force a genuinely shallow local
  clone.

- **A `scope: 'tree'` check in `tools/precedent_check.py` can silently
  report a false *pass* on an under-fetched local clone, not just degrade
  loudly like the two entries above.** `parallel-artifact-ledger` walks
  `git log --no-merges -- <member-dir>` for each harness-adapter directory
  and fails on any commit whose hash isn't in `templates/harness/LEDGER.md`.
  2026-09-05: a local run reported `0 violated`, but GitHub Actions' own
  checkout of the exact same commit reported a real violation (twice) —
  `templates/harness/LEDGER.md` was missing a row for a commit from
  five weeks before the ledger file existed. The local clone's history
  simply didn't reach back far enough for `git log` to find that commit at
  all, so the check had nothing to flag — an empty result read as "clean,"
  not as "couldn't check." `git fetch --depth=1000 origin <branch>` (or
  deeper — this check needs the *entire* history of the directories it
  walks, not just enough for the current branch's own diff) before
  trusting a clean local run of any `scope: 'tree'` check.

- **The leak gate's vocabulary layer fails open unless you also set the git
  config.** `export PRECEDENT_LEAK_BLOCKLIST=<a path OUTSIDE this repo>` is
  half of it; without `git config precedent.requireVocabulary true` a shell
  that starts without the variable prints `PARTIAL`, exits 0, and the push
  goes through with only the structural rules applied. Every push here is
  publication into a public repository, so the half-configured state is the
  dangerous one. See `python3 tools/leak_gate.py --explain`.

- **A session's local checkout can be stale enough to look complete while
  missing real, merged work — with no error.** A session opened here on
  2026-09-01 had a local `precedent-beta-v01` that shared **zero** commits
  with origin's tip: phases 1.5 through 4, every `spec/*.md` brief, and
  `CHANGES_TO_TELL_ALEX.md` simply did not exist locally. `git status`
  reported "up to date with origin" because that check runs against
  whatever the remote-tracking ref happened to be at last fetch, and no
  fetch had happened yet. Reading the tree, running the harness, anything
  short of `git fetch` first would have silently analyzed or built on a
  months-stale snapshot. [.claude/hooks/session-start.sh](.claude/hooks/session-start.sh)
  now fetches the current branch and warns loudly (never fails the
  session — a git failure here must not block startup) if local `HEAD`
  differs from origin's, distinguishing "behind" from "shares no history
  at all" (a force-push or rewrite, the worse case). If you see that
  warning, and your working tree is clean: `git checkout -B <branch>
  origin/<branch>`.

- **On a shallow clone, `git merge-base` between two *different* branches
  can exit 1 ("no common ancestor") even when the branches genuinely share
  history — and that false negative reads exactly like a destructive
  force-push.** On 2026-09-06, comparing `precedent-beta-v01` against an
  older feature branch this way returned exit 1, which looked like proof
  the two had disjoint, independently-rewritten histories; the session
  nearly asked the user to confirm a branch rewrite that had never
  happened. `git merge-base <A> origin/main` and `git merge-base <B>
  origin/main` each resolved fine in the meantime — the shallow fetch
  simply didn't reach far enough back to contain the real common ancestor
  of `<A>` and `<B>` themselves, even though each one individually had a
  shorter path back to `main`. `git merge-base` exiting 1 is not by itself
  evidence of a rewritten or discarded branch: `git fetch --unshallow
  origin` (or a deep enough bounded `git fetch --depth=<N> origin
  <branch>`, per the entries above) and recheck before concluding
  anything about two branches' relationship.

- **Inherited audits that have nothing to inspect say so, rather than
  passing or failing.** [tools/practice_audit.py](tools/practice_audit.py)
  wants a `process/manifest*.json` this repo does not have, because this
  repo is the upstream it audits a *dependent* repo against. It used to
  exit non-zero for that reason — permanently red, so nobody ran it — and
  [tools/doc_sync.py](tools/doc_sync.py) and
  [tools/model_audit.py](tools/model_audit.py), whose `PAIRS` and
  `INSTRUMENTED` lists were then empty, printed `OK` on having inspected
  nothing: a confident all-clear from a scan that never ran. All three now
  say NOT APPLICABLE with the reason, and
  [tools/precedent_check.py](tools/precedent_check.py) reports that as
  skipped rather than passed. (`PAIRS` and `INSTRUMENTED` have both since
  been filled in here — two documents and one script — so only
  `practice_audit.py` is still NOT APPLICABLE in this repo. Corrected
  2026-09-06; the entry had gone on asserting all three were empty.)

- **`git log --format=%P` silently reports no parents at all for a commit
  sitting at a shallow clone's boundary, even when it really has two.** Writing a mechanical check for `precedent-team-maintainers`
  (a `checked_by` script that needed to tell a merge commit apart from an
  ordinary one, to exempt merges from a per-commit rule) used `%P` and
  worked perfectly against a full clone, then silently misclassified the
  exact commit sitting at the shallow boundary as parentless the moment the
  same script ran against a fresh `--depth 1` clone of the same repo —
  reproduced directly, not just suspected. Git's pretty-printers respect
  the shallow graft for traversal purposes even though the commit object's
  own header still genuinely records both parents. `git cat-file -p <sha>`
  reads that header directly and is unaffected — count lines starting with
  `parent ` instead of parsing `%P`, anywhere a check needs to know a
  shallow-clone-safe parent count or parent list.

- **A consuming repo's own mechanical check against materialized
  `tools/checks/`/`practices/` output cannot just call
  `precedent_resolve.load_config()` and trust every source it lists.** A
  repo-local (or team, or individual) source's own check script belongs
  under that source's own declared `path` (`local/tools/checks/` for a
  source declared `path: "local"`), never directly in the consuming
  repo's own `tools/checks/` — that is `precedent_materialize.py`'s own
  *output* directory, deleted and rewritten from every declared source on
  every `precedent_sync_views.py` run, so a hand-added file there
  survives only until the next sync. A dependent repo built exactly this
  mechanical check (verify every materialized `check_*.py` has a
  byte-identical twin in its source) and shipped a first version that
  resolved sources live to decide what counts as reachable — it passed
  locally, then failed the repo's own CI on the very next push, on `main`
  itself, flagging every check script sourced from its team and
  individual sources. A team source is a live sibling clone outside the
  repo; an individual source resolves only via a private, non-repo
  user-level config — neither exists in a bare CI checkout, and never
  will, so "this source didn't resolve here" is not evidence of an
  orphaned file. The fix: attribute by the *committed* `MANIFEST.json`'s
  own `checks` list (already written by `precedent_materialize.py`,
  recording exactly which source produced each file) instead of by live
  resolution — a file with no entry there at all is the real signature of
  a hand-dropped orphan and always fails; a recorded file whose source
  simply is not reachable in the current environment is skipped, never
  failed.

## Working in this repo

- **Default branch is `main`; work on a feature branch; PRs are the norm**
  here (this repo is public and is the shared upstream).
- **Most changes arrive as check-in PRs from dependent repos** (INSTALL.md
  §4). Reviewing one, you are the **second scrub line**: the contributing
  repo's blocklist caught its known private vocabulary; you catch what it
  didn't know yet. A name, number, or incident detail that reads
  subject-specific rather than generic should be challenged before merge —
  and added to the contributor's blocklist, not fixed up here after
  publication.
- **Direct edits are fine** for content about this repo itself (README,
  practice wording, engine code); abstracted lessons still only enter via
  a scrubbed check-in from where they were learned.
- **Before committing:** `python3 tools/doc_lint.py` on markdown you
  touched (`pip install cmarkgfm` — the session-start hook does this);
  after touching the deck engine, rebuild the sample both ways:
  `python3 deck/build_deck.py deck/sample` and `--send`.
- **Two check levels** (practice `two-check-levels`): **light check** is
  `python3 tools/doc_lint.py` on the markdown you touched — the fast,
  constant pass above, run before every commit without thinking about it.
  **deep check** is the full gate suite run before push or merge:
  `python3 tools/verify_harness.py`, `python3 tools/doc_lint.py`,
  `python3 tools/leak_gate.py`, `python3 tools/precedent_check.py`, and
  `python3 tools/doc_sync.py`. **What matters is `0 failed` and
  `0 violated`, never a passed/skipped count** — those grow as checks are
  added, so a figure written down here goes stale by design; see
  [spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md](spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md)'s closing section,
  which says the same thing and records the audit that found a hardcoded
  one already wrong. Light check gates a commit; deep check gates a push.

## Conventions (every session, every reply)

- **Reply convention** ([reply-links-files](practices/reply-links-files.md)):
  every reply that created or modified
  files ends with a **"Files touched"** list — for each file, the branch
  link (readable now) plus the post-merge `main` link, with a one-line
  description. The reader opens the work from the chat; they never go
  hunting for it. A touched HTML render or picture also gets its
  rendered-view (artifact) link when the harness offers one — a repo link
  shows source, not the render.
- **Doc references are links** ([doc-references-are-links](practices/doc-references-are-links.md)):
  relative markdown links,
  never bare backticked filenames. Use `≈`, not `~`, for "approximately".
- **Volatile rules carry their dates** ([volatile-rules-carry-dates](practices/volatile-rules-carry-dates.md)):
  anything asserted
  here about an external platform or tool carries *as of / verified
  `<date>`* inline, in the contributor's local calendar date, not the
  agent's system clock.
- **Outward-facing documents use the reader's words** ([readers-vocabulary](practices/readers-vocabulary.md)): this
  repo's README, [SETUP.md](SETUP.md), and
  [templates/GETTING_STARTED.md](templates/GETTING_STARTED.md) are read by
  people who are not developers. Terms that name a category are the
  reader's word, a plain equivalent, or glossed inline — never left to a
  glossary. Jargon arrives from the sources a session just read, so run
  the check as a separate pass after drafting.
- **Built decks are delivered** ([deck/README.md](deck/README.md)
  convention 3): a session that builds a deck attaches the HTML into the
  conversation as a viewable file in the same reply, and only ever sends
  the `--send` build externally.
