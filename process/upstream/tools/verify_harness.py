# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RETIRED: byte-identical regeneration.
#
# Phase 1's converter was mechanical -- it routed each paragraph by the bold
# label that opened it -- so the catalogue could be rebuilt from practices/
# and diffed against PRACTICES.md byte for byte. That was the right proof for
# a mechanical conversion, and it held: 52 practices, no unexplained
# difference, modulo three documented source quirks.
#
# It cannot survive the phase-1.5 editorial re-split, and not because the
# re-split is unfaithful. Re-homing a paragraph from Rule to Why moves where
# cmd_build re-emits the "**Why.**" label, so the rebuilt catalogue differs
# from the source however faithful the move was. A check that fails on
# correct work is worse than no check: it gets suppressed, and then it is not
# there when something is actually wrong.
#
# Its two claims are both still checked, by name, and one of them more
# strongly than before:
#
#   CONTENT  -> check_content_preserved_by_sentence. Byte-identical compared
#               a reassembly; this compares every sentence of every practice
#               against PRACTICES.md directly, in both directions. It is
#               strictly stronger: a single word reworded inside a Rule
#               passes both word-multiset checks (the reworded word can
#               lowercase to the same token) and fails this one.
#   ORDERING -> check_section_source_order. Text may be re-homed between
#               sections; within a section it must still appear in its
#               original source order.
#
# Plus check_no_lost_content, check_list_structure_preserved and
# check_corruption_drop_is_a_duplicate, none of which existed when
# byte-identical was the whole story.
#
# tools/split_practices.py build still renders a catalogue view and
# `build --diff` still runs -- but its diff is now expected output showing
# the editorial re-split, not a defect report.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Content preservation across an EDITORIAL re-split.
#
# Phase 1's converter was mechanical, so "byte-identical regeneration" could
# prove it lost nothing: rebuild PRACTICES.md from practices/ and diff. That
# check cannot survive the phase-1.5 editorial pass, by construction -- the
# whole point of that pass is that text MOVES between sections, so the
# rebuilt catalogue's **Why.** label lands somewhere else and the diff is
# non-empty no matter how faithful the move was.
#
# It is replaced by something stronger on the dimension that actually
# matters, and weaker only on one that does not. The plan's own rule for the
# converter is a SENTENCE rule -- "no sentence may appear in the output that
# does not appear in the input" (Migration, The Converter) -- so that is what
# is checked, in both directions, against PRACTICES.md itself. PRACTICES.md
# is the immutable upstream source and stays in the repo, so this is a
# permanent, non-circular guarantee that survives any future re-split:
# whatever the sections end up being, their combined content is exactly
# BestPractice's content, sentence for sentence.
#
# What is lost is the ORDERING claim byte-identical regeneration also made,
# and check_section_source_order restores it: within each section, sentences
# must still appear in their original relative source order. Any pure
# re-homing preserves that; scrambling does not.

    says. That is a check on the TREE, not on the GATE -- it passes just as
    happily when the gate has stopped looking. Three real misses were found

    that would have published a private term:

      * a file added in one commit and removed in a later one in the same
        push, invisible to the net `git diff A..B` the gate used;
      * a leak in a STAGED blob, cleaned up in the working tree afterwards,
        because the gate read the file off disk rather than out of git;

def check_practice_audit_fires():
    """practice_audit.py's --update-baseline, stated as cases against a
    throwaway manifest (practice: mistakes-become-rules).

    Regression case, found in the wild via a dependent repo's check-in
    (themorgan/WorkingWithAI, 2026-09-04): a 'diverged' manifest entry
    marks a file as a deliberate, permanent customization that must never
    be proposed for export -- the whole point of the status. Before this
    fix, --update-baseline read ANY hash mismatch against the recorded
    local_sha256 as "the local file changed, so the divergence must be
    resolved" and silently flipped 'diverged' to 'synced' -- even when the
    mismatch was really just a stale baseline already wrong in the
    manifest, with the file itself untouched. Nothing in the tool's output
    named the flip, so it was invisible short of hand-diffing the manifest.
    A repo carrying a diverged entry could lose that marking on the next
    routine --update-baseline run for an unrelated reason, and a later
    check-in (INSTALL.md §4) could then propose the customization for
    export with nothing downstream able to tell "genuinely synced" apart
    from "flipped by this bug".

    Asserts the fix from outside the tool: run --update-baseline as a
    subprocess against a scratch manifest and read the entries back."""

    check_decision_records_not_inline_fires() can exercise it against
    scratch git repositories instead of only ever running once, for real,

    'na' (detail is the not-applicable reason) or 'checked' (detail is the
    list of violation message strings; ok is False if that list is
    non-empty).

    WHY THE COMPARISON BASE IS THE MERGE-BASE WITH @{upstream}, NOT HEAD.
    The original version gated on `git status --porcelain` being non-empty
    and compared disk content against HEAD -- so it only ever looked at
    UNCOMMITTED changes. The moment a violating amendment is committed --
    the normal state for reviewing any already-pushed branch or PR, which
    AGENTS.md itself describes as the modal review path here -- the
    porcelain check comes back empty, the function returned early with
    "was not changed", and the violation was never inspected at all.
    Confirmed live: an identical inline entry passed as UNCOMMITTED and
    silently reported not-applicable the instant it was committed, no
    diagnostic. Comparing against the upstream merge-base instead of HEAD
    also correctly covers every commit this branch has added since it
    diverged, not just the most recent one -- HEAD~1 would have missed an
    earlier commit in a multi-commit push. Falls back to HEAD when there is
    no configured upstream (a fresh checkout with no remote, a detached

    to DO, not merely that something applies. That is a judgment about
    meaning, and most of it cannot be checked -- a review pass over the split
    practices caught three defects that every check here passed, and only one
    of the three had a mechanical signature.

    This is that one. A Rule ending on "Three rules:" or "Two things fix it:"
    has had its payload moved to Detail and now announces a list it does not
    contain. It is the cheapest and least ambiguous form of the failure, so
    it is the form that gets a check; the other two -- a Rule whose scope gate
    moved to Detail, and a Rule using a term Detail defines -- are recorded in
    spec/PRACTICE_FORMAT.md as needing a reader, because they do.

    `readers-vocabulary` named a linter with no vocabulary check in it,
    `acronyms-glossary` named a check that only ever warns, and four named
    gates that were RED on this repository for reasons unrelated to either
    practice. A claim nobody has watched fire reads as coverage and is not.

    So this asserts what each check is supposed to DO, from outside it: copy
    the tree into a scratch repository, PLANT the violation the practice
    exists to prevent, run tools/precedent_check.py --only SLUG as a
    subprocess, and require a non-zero exit. Each case also requires the
    UNPLANTED baseline to come back clean, because a check that fires on
    everything is as useless as one that fires on nothing -- that direction is
    what caught the first version of the quick-index check, which counted rows

def check_show_flags_unreachable_materialized_source():
    """practices/verify-postcondition.md, applied to the READ side of the
    gap practices/session-bootstrap.md's Story records on the write side.
    A materialized practices/<slug>.md (tools/precedent_materialize.py's
    output, in a consumer repo resolving universal/team/individual/
    repo-local together) is whatever was on disk at the last successful
    materialize() run -- precedent_show.py reading it back proves nothing
    about whether the source that produced it is reachable THIS session.
    Before this, a session could get a clean, confident-looking Rule
    printout from a source that had silently dropped off, with nothing to
    tell that apart from a source genuinely still live -- exactly the
    false-confidence case the self-heal fix (tools/precedent_resolve.py)
    makes MORE likely to occur unnoticed, not less: a source can now fail
    to resolve in one particular session while a materialized tree from an
    earlier, working session still reads back clean.

    Six stated cases: a real individual source materialized and read while
    reachable (silent, no note); the same slug read again after that
    source's directory is removed (the note fires, naming the level and
    the materialize timestamp); a universal-sourced slug in the SAME
    materialized tree, whose source never leaves (stays silent throughout
    -- the check is source-specific, not a blanket flag on every slug once
    anything is missing); restoring the source and re-reading (silent
    again -- not sticky, re-checked every call); a plain SOURCE repo (this
    one) with no MANIFEST.json at all (never adds a note, regardless of
    slug); and multiple slugs in one call sourced differently (each gets
    its own independent verdict, matching precedent_show.py's own
    per-slug concatenation).

    EXTENDED 2026-09-06 (TODO.md item 20, closed) to cover
    precedent_gate.py and precedent_paths.py too -- both read
    practices/*.md directly, the same way precedent_show.py itself used
    to, so the note above never reached a practice loaded through the
    gate-triggered or path-triggered channel. Closed by having both
    modules `import precedent_show as ps` and call its two helpers
    directly, NOT by a subprocess call to precedent_show.py (would mean
    re-parsing its own "### slug\\n<body>" stdout format back into
    structured data purely to recover a note this file can already print
    itself) and NOT by a second, copy-pasted implementation
    (engine-plus-host-shims: one mechanism, shared by import, the same
    discipline all three files already use for split_practices.py). Two
    more stated cases below reuse the same indiv/uni fixture with one
    added practice (gated + a narrow applies_to, so both channels can
    actually reach it), checked reachable and unreachable exactly like

    """practices/session-bootstrap.md's Detail, tested rather than trusted
    -- and corrected 2026-09-06 after this check's own first version
    proved a false claim clean.

    tools/precedent_resolve.py's own load_config() treats a still-missing
    individual config, on a remote session, as "try the hook once more"
    rather than "no individual set" -- this is the ENTIRE fix for the
    incident practices/session-bootstrap.md's Story records (two
    independent adopters' SessionStart hook running to completion before
    the agent's own turn, and therefore its add_repo call, could start).
    A first version of this check also asserted that
    tools/precedent_source_bootstrap.py retrying "instead of trying once"
    was a second, contributing half. That was tested here only by calling
    the tool directly against synthetic fixtures -- never inside a real
    SessionStart hook on a genuinely fresh Claude Code Web session, which
    is the one environment where the claim was actually false: a
    SessionStart hook's execution window and the agent's own first turn
    never overlap in time, so no retry count or delay inside the hook can
    ever observe add_repo access appearing. A follow-up testing session
    ran that real test and disproved it directly. This check's own
    passing runs never caught that, and could not have: it proves the
    tool's CODE does what the code says (retries N times, degrades
    gracefully), which was never in question -- it cannot prove the
    premise about the outside world (whether a retry, in that specific
    execution context, has anything to retry into) the retry was written
    against. Case 6 below locks in the correction: the tool now defaults
    to a single attempt, precisely because a default of more than one
    bought nothing for the case it was sized for.

    Fixture: a real local git repo served over file:// -- not a bare path;
    this repo's own environment-gotchas.md already names why (`git clone
    --depth 1 /some/path` is ignored; only a real transport gets real
    clone semantics, and `file://` is what forces that locally). Six
    stated cases, all fast: --retry-delay 0 proves an explicitly-requested
    retry count without a real wall-clock wait."""
