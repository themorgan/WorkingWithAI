# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RETIRED: byte-identical regeneration.
#
# Phase 1's converter was mechanical -- it routed each paragraph by the bold
# label that opened it -- so the catalogue could be rebuilt from practices/
# and diffed against PRACTICES.md byte for byte. That was the right proof for
# a mechanical conversion, and it held: 52 practices, no unexplained
# difference, modulo three documented source quirks.
#
# It cannot survive the phase-1.5 editorial re-split, and not because the
# re-split is unfaithful. Re-homing a paragraph from Rule to Why moves where
# cmd_build re-emits the "**Why.**" label, so the rebuilt catalogue differs
# from the source however faithful the move was. A check that fails on
# correct work is worse than no check: it gets suppressed, and then it is not
# there when something is actually wrong.
#
# Its two claims are both still checked, by name, and one of them more
# strongly than before:
#
#   CONTENT  -> check_content_preserved_by_sentence. Byte-identical compared
#               a reassembly; this compares every sentence of every practice
#               against PRACTICES.md directly, in both directions. It is
#               strictly stronger: a single word reworded inside a Rule
#               passes both word-multiset checks (the reworded word can
#               lowercase to the same token) and fails this one.
#   ORDERING -> check_section_source_order. Text may be re-homed between
#               sections; within a section it must still appear in its
#               original source order.
#
# Plus check_no_lost_content, check_list_structure_preserved and
# check_corruption_drop_is_a_duplicate, none of which existed when
# byte-identical was the whole story.
#
# tools/split_practices.py build still renders a catalogue view and
# `build --diff` still runs -- but its diff is now expected output showing
# the editorial re-split, not a defect report.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Content preservation across an EDITORIAL re-split.
#
# Phase 1's converter was mechanical, so "byte-identical regeneration" could
# prove it lost nothing: rebuild PRACTICES.md from practices/ and diff. That
# check cannot survive the phase-1.5 editorial pass, by construction -- the
# whole point of that pass is that text MOVES between sections, so the
# rebuilt catalogue's **Why.** label lands somewhere else and the diff is
# non-empty no matter how faithful the move was.
#
# It is replaced by something stronger on the dimension that actually
# matters, and weaker only on one that does not. The plan's own rule for the
# converter is a SENTENCE rule -- "no sentence may appear in the output that
# does not appear in the input" (Migration, The Converter) -- so that is what
# is checked, in both directions, against PRACTICES.md itself. PRACTICES.md
# is the immutable upstream source and stays in the repo, so this is a
# permanent, non-circular guarantee that survives any future re-split:
# whatever the sections end up being, their combined content is exactly
# BestPractice's content, sentence for sentence.
#
# What is lost is the ORDERING claim byte-identical regeneration also made,
# and check_section_source_order restores it: within each section, sentences
# must still appear in their original relative source order. Any pure
# re-homing preserves that; scrambling does not.

    says. That is a check on the TREE, not on the GATE -- it passes just as
    happily when the gate has stopped looking. Three real misses were found

    that would have published a private term:

      * a file added in one commit and removed in a later one in the same
        push, invisible to the net `git diff A..B` the gate used;
      * a leak in a STAGED blob, cleaned up in the working tree afterwards,
        because the gate read the file off disk rather than out of git;
      * a leak in a COMMIT MESSAGE, which was never scanned at all.

    So this check asserts what the gate is supposed to DO, from outside it:
    plant each case in a scratch repository, run the gate as a subprocess,
    and require the exit status. Every case here fails against the gate as it
    stood before those fixes. The blocked words are invented for this check --

    asserted as stated cases (PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, phase-3 done-when: "a
    consumer repo resolves all three and precedence is tested").

    WHY THE FIXTURE IS BUILT IN A TEMPORARY DIRECTORY AND NOT COMMITTED.
    Levels are repositories, not directories. A committed fixture holding a
    team- or individual-shaped tree inside Precedent is exactly the shortcut
    the plan forbids and the leak gate refuses by path -- and a check whose
    setup requires switching off another check is a check that ends up
    switching it off. The fixture practices below are invented, and exist
    only for the length of this function.

    EACH CASE IS A RULE FROM THE PLAN, NOT A RESTATEMENT OF THE RESOLVER.
    They are written from "Precedence, and the One Case Where the Individual
    Does Not Win" and from "One Individual Set per Person": what SHOULD
    happen, so the check disagrees with the resolver when the resolver is
    wrong rather than agreeing with it by construction."""

    the normal state for reviewing any already-pushed branch or PR, which
    AGENTS.md itself describes as the modal review path here -- the
    porcelain check comes back empty, the function returned early with
    "was not changed", and the violation was never inspected at all.
    Confirmed live: an identical inline entry passed as UNCOMMITTED and
    silently reported not-applicable the instant it was committed, no
    diagnostic. Comparing against the upstream merge-base instead of HEAD
    also correctly covers every commit this branch has added since it
    diverged, not just the most recent one -- HEAD~1 would have missed an

    WHY THIS EXISTS. Until phase 4 the only thing verifying a `checked_by:`
    was check_checked_by_targets_exist() above, which asserts the named FILE
    is present. Tested one by one, the eight inherited claims came apart:
    `readers-vocabulary` named a linter with no vocabulary check in it,
    `acronyms-glossary` named a check that only ever warns, and four named
    gates that were RED on this repository for reasons unrelated to either
    practice. A claim nobody has watched fire reads as coverage and is not.

    So this asserts what each check is supposed to DO, from outside it: copy
    the tree into a scratch repository, PLANT the violation the practice
    exists to prevent, run tools/precedent_check.py --only SLUG as a
    subprocess, and require a non-zero exit. Each case also requires the
    UNPLANTED baseline to come back clean, because a check that fires on
    everything is as useless as one that fires on nothing -- that direction is
    what caught the first version of the quick-index check, which counted rows
    from the middle of the header line and reported zero on a table with
    twenty-six.
