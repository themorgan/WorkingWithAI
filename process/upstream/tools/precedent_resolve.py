"""precedent_resolve.py — resolve the four sources into one set of practices
(PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "Source — Who a Practice Belongs To" and
"Precedence, and the One Case Where the Individual Does Not Win").

A practice's LEVEL is not a field. It is implied by which repository the file
lives in, "so it cannot drift from reality" — universal in Precedent, team in
one private repo per team, individual in one private repo per person,
repo-local in the consuming repo's own tree. This tool is what turns "up to
four repositories" into "the practices in force here".

WHO DECLARES WHICH SOURCE, AND WHY THAT SPLIT IS A PRIVACY BOUNDARY RATHER
THAN A CONVENIENCE.

  The CONSUMER REPO declares universal, its team set, and its own repo-local
  set, in a tracked config file (precedent.json). Everyone working there
  gets those, and everyone working there can already read them.

  THE PERSON declares their own individual set in their USER-LEVEL config,
  outside any shared repo (~/.config/precedent/config.json, or wherever
  PRECEDENT_USER_CONFIG points). If a project repo named someone's individual
  set it would leak that set's existence and location to everyone on the
  team, and their sessions would try to fetch a repository they cannot read.

  So two people working in the same repo resolve DIFFERENT sets, each seeing
  their own personal practices and neither seeing the other's. That falls out
  of where the declaration lives; it is not a rule anyone has to remember.

PRECEDENCE is team > repo-local > individual > universal, by slug (changed
2026-09-03 from the phase-3 individual > team > universal order — see
spec/SOURCES.md for the reasoning). A team's rules bind everyone in it, so
they are the strongest -- closest to actual law for that group. Universal
covers every Precedent user in the world, so by design it is the lowest
common denominator and the weakest. An individual's own practices sit in
between: more binding than a rule meant for the whole world, less binding
than what a person's own team requires of them. Repo-local sits alongside
that same ladder, between individual and team, since it speaks to the actual
working reality of one specific repo rather than a person's general style --
but nothing here is fixed forever: any practice at any level can still be
reordered relative to one slug via `overrides:`, or protected from every
level above it via `severity: blocking` (see below). This is a property of
the resolver, not a rule written down and hoped to be read.

THE ONE CASE PRECEDENCE ALONE DOES NOT DECIDE. A practice at any level below
the top of PRECEDENCE (currently: repo-local, individual, or universal) may
be marked `severity: blocking`, which means no source ranked above it can
override it by ordinary precedence -- only a same-level `overrides:` still
can. This is for the rare case where a lower-ranked practice must hold
regardless of what a higher-ranked source happens to say: a universal
information-leak guard a team must not be able to quietly turn off for
itself, say. This is the difference between a practice about HOW SOMETHING
IS DONE and one about WHAT MUST NEVER HAPPEN.

DEGRADING GRACEFULLY IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, not an error path. A fresh
cloud session with no persistent home directory has no local individual set.
When a declared source is missing, the resolver runs on what it has and SAYS
SO — it never silently pretends personal practices were applied. A missing
source is reported on stderr and in `--json` under "missing"; only a
malformed source, or two practices at the same level claiming one slug, is
fatal.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py                 # resolve, human-readable
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py --json          # the resolved set as data
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py --repo DIR      # resolve for another repo
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py --explain SLUG  # how one slug resolved
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py --strict        # a missing source is fatal
Exit: 0 on a resolved set, 1 on a conflict, a malformed source, or --strict
with a source missing.

    that is the privacy boundary above, and a mistake that is silent here is
    a mistake nobody finds. A repo-local source is refused if its path
    resolves to somewhere OUTSIDE the declaring repo -- the whole point of
    the level is that it never leaves the one repo it describes
    (practice: layered-practice-packs: "repo-local ... live in that repo's
    instructions files and never leave"); a repo-local entry pointing
    elsewhere would let a repo quietly claim another repo's tree as if it
    were its own local content. It does NOT have to be the repo's bare
    root, though: a subdirectory (the recommended convention -- see
    PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md's "Source" section) is exactly as "inside the
    repo" as the root itself, and keeps repo-local's own hand-authored
    practices/ physically separate from tools/precedent_materialize.py's
    output directory, which by convention IS the bare root's practices/ --
    a real, reproduced bug (not a hypothetical): materializing a repo-local
    source declared at `path: "."` into that same repo's own root silently
    overwrote the hand-authored source file the moment another source won
    resolution on a shared slug, with no trace left that it had ever held
    different content. `path: "."` still resolves HERE -- this validation
    only guarantees the path stays inside the declaring repo, not that it
    differs from wherever a session later points precedent_materialize.py's
    --out -- but a 2026-09-03 deep-check audit found the silent-overwrite
    case survived that first fix (which only protected a WINNING practice's
    file, not one that loses right where it lives) plus a second, worse
    case (materialize()'s own prior output gets read back on the next run
