"""precedent_resolve.py — resolve the three sources into one set of practices
(PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "Source — Who a Practice Belongs To" and
"Precedence, and the One Case Where the Individual Does Not Win").

A practice's LEVEL is not a field. It is implied by which repository the file
lives in, "so it cannot drift from reality" — universal in Precedent, team in
one private repo per team, individual in one private repo per person. This
tool is what turns "three repositories" into "the practices in force here".

WHO DECLARES WHICH SOURCE, AND WHY THAT SPLIT IS A PRIVACY BOUNDARY RATHER
THAN A CONVENIENCE.

  The CONSUMER REPO declares universal plus its team set, in a tracked config
  file (precedent.json). Everyone working there gets those, and everyone
  working there can already read them.

  THE PERSON declares their own individual set in their USER-LEVEL config,
  outside any shared repo (~/.config/precedent/config.json, or wherever
  PRECEDENT_USER_CONFIG points). If a project repo named someone's individual
  set it would leak that set's existence and location to everyone on the
  team, and their sessions would try to fetch a repository they cannot read.

  So two people working in the same repo resolve DIFFERENT sets, each seeing
  their own personal practices and neither seeing the other's. That falls out
  of where the declaration lives; it is not a rule anyone has to remember.

PRECEDENCE is individual > team > universal, by slug — RPP's `bestpractice-
wins` generalized into the engine, so it is a property of the resolver rather
than a rule written down and hoped to be read. A practice may also name a
lower-source slug in `overrides:` to replace a practice it does not share a
name with.

THE ONE CASE WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT WIN. A team or universal practice
marked `severity: blocking` cannot be overridden by a higher-precedence
source. Plain precedence would let a personal "keep the tone casual" beat a
team's "this client work is always formal", which is right for how a person
works and wrong for what a shared deliverable looks like. This is the
difference between a practice about HOW I WORK and one about WHAT WE SHIP.

DEGRADING GRACEFULLY IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, not an error path. A fresh
cloud session with no persistent home directory has no local individual set.
When a declared source is missing, the resolver runs on what it has and SAYS
SO — it never silently pretends personal practices were applied. A missing
source is reported on stderr and in `--json` under "missing"; only a
malformed source, or two practices at the same level claiming one slug, is
fatal.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py                 # resolve, human-readable
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py --json          # the resolved set as data
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py --repo DIR      # resolve for another repo
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py --explain SLUG  # how one slug resolved
  python3 tools/precedent_resolve.py --strict        # a missing source is fatal
Exit: 0 on a resolved set, 1 on a conflict, a malformed source, or --strict
with a source missing.
