"""catalogue_stats.py — the figures about this catalogue that documents cite.

Every number here was, until phase 4, hand-typed into prose in several
documents at once. That is the failure `docs-track-models` describes, and it
had already happened: [spec/LOADER.md](../spec/LOADER.md)'s status table said
the resident block was "~621 tokens" for the whole of phase 3, while phase
3's own Rule/Detail split had halved it to ≈312. Every gate in the repository
was green, because no gate could see a number in a sentence.

So the numbers live here, the documents carry a generated block, and
tools/doc_sync.py fails on drift. The figures this script DECLARES IT OWNS
(owned_figures()) may not be restated in the prose around that block --
a restatement is a second copy with no gate on it.
