"""precedent_check.py — the ENFORCED loading channel, made real (phase 4).

PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to Load", names
four channels. Three were built in phase 2 and 3; this is the fourth:

    **Enforced.** Practices with `checked_by` are never loaded at all. The
    check's failure message *is* the rule, delivered at the moment of
    violation.

Before this existed, `checked_by:` was a *claim*: a string naming a script
that existed. The harness verified the file was there and nothing else, so
eight practices reported enforcement that nobody had ever seen fire. Tested
one by one at the start of phase 4, the eight came apart:
`readers-vocabulary` named a linter with no vocabulary check in it at all;
`acronyms-glossary` named a check that only ever warns; the two practices
naming `doc_sync.py` and the two naming `practice_audit.py` named gates that
were RED on this repository, for reasons that had nothing to do with either
practice. A claim nobody tested is worth less than no claim, because it
reads as coverage.

So this module is deliberately not "a script that checks practices". It is a
registry with one entry per enforced practice, and every entry owes two
things:

  * **a failure message that IS the rule.** On a violation the practice's
    own `## Rule` is printed, read through the same code path every other
    channel uses (`split_practices._read_practice_file`, via
    `precedent_show`'s reader) — never a paraphrase that can drift from it.
  * **a test that proves it fires.** tools/verify_harness.py plants a real
    violation for every registered slug in a throwaway repository and
    asserts the exit status, then asserts the unplanted baseline is clean.
    A slug registered here without a case there fails the harness.

A CHECK THAT CANNOT RUN REPORTS THAT IT DID NOT RUN. Every graceful-failure
path here ends in SKIPPED with a reason, never in a pass. This repository
has been bitten four times by the opposite -- a scan with an empty input set
printing OK -- and the whole point of an enforced practice is that its check
is the only thing standing where the prose used to be.

Scopes, because a practice is not always a property of a file:

  tree      a property of the repository as it stands (an index exists, the
            generated views are current). Always runs.
  change    a property of what a change adds or edits (a new practice
            carries its incident). Runs against the files in scope.
  turn-end  a property of the state you wanted AFTER an operation (nothing
            unpushed, no published history rewritten). Excluded from the
            default run -- mid-work it is not a violation -- and run by
            --turn-end, which is where a Stop hook calls it.

Run:
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py                  # tree + change scopes
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --turn-end       # the end-of-turn scope
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --only SLUG      # one practice
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --paths A B      # explicit change scope
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --all            # change scope = whole tree
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --list           # what is registered
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --explain        # what each check does NOT check
  python3 tools/precedent_check.py --strict         # a SKIP is a failure
