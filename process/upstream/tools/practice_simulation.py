"""practice_simulation.py -- phase 2 of spec/SIMULATION_BRIEF.md: synthetic
scenario generation, replacing tools/routing_eval.py's fixed 20-commit case
set with cases that are INVENTED, not replayed.

WHY. Morgan's own objection to phase 1's plan: replaying the same historical
commits over and over is not a simulation, and tunes the loader's own inputs
(globs, occasion wording) against the exact set that scores it -- the v5
round in spec/LOADER.md already shows this happening ("a glob pass converted
reach failures into judgment failures on the SAME 20 cases"). A fixed
benchmark you optimize against stops being evidence.

WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. For a sample of on-demand practices (fresh each
batch -- see "new-batch" below), a generation prompt asks for THREE
scenarios per practice, never reused across batches:
  positive     a fictional situation that should trigger the practice.
  negative     a near-miss that resembles the trigger on the surface but
               should NOT trigger it.
  adversarial  a situation that genuinely calls for the practice, framed to
               look like something else or easy to miss -- this is the case
               the plain positive case does not test.
Each scenario also names 1-3 plausible file paths it touches, so the REAL
path-triggered channel (tools/precedent_paths.py, not a re-implementation of
it) can be exercised mechanically, exactly as spec/LOADER.md's other evals
do.

THIS TOOL NEVER GENERATES OR JUDGES ANYTHING ITSELF. Like
tools/routing_eval.py before it, it only manages the file-based handoff: it
writes prompts, and a person -- directly, or by explicitly asking an agent
session to in that turn -- runs them and saves the results back. Nothing
here calls a model API, imports a model client, or is invoked from a hook,
gate, or session-start script, and it must never be wired to one: every
step below is a file written by this tool and a file a PERSON chooses to
fill in by running the prompt. See "Never automatic" in
spec/SIMULATION_BRIEF.md.

WHAT V1 DOES NOT DO, STATED PLAINLY. It measures ROUTING (did the loader's
real resident block + occasion index + real path-channel output lead to
naming the right practice), single-hop only (the cheapest arm
spec/ATTENTION_CEILING.md already validates as legitimate, not an ad hoc
shortcut). It does NOT yet have the treatment agent perform the synthetic
task and run a real checked_by script against the output (behavioral_replay
--with-checks phase 1's mechanical-correctness idea, extended to synthetic
work) -- that needs a real sandboxed workspace for the agent to edit files
in, which this file-based prompt/answer handoff does not provide. That is
real, separate, harder follow-on work, not silently folded in here.

PHASE 3: MULTI-REPO (spec/SIMULATION_BRIEF.md section 6). `new-batch` and
`route` accept `--repo-root PATH`, pointing every step at a DIFFERENT
repo's own materialized practice set and its own generated loader block --
not BestPractice's. This is the test a single-repo simulation structurally
cannot do: whether routing AND source precedence (a repo-local override
correctly taking priority over the universal practice it overrides) hold
somewhere other than here. No real dependent repo was attached to the
session that built this, so `build-fixture-repo` constructs one: a small,
committed, honestly-labeled FIXTURE consumer repo at
evals/simulation/fixtures/demo-consumer-repo/, with its own fictional file
tree and one repo-local override, materialized through the real
tools/precedent_sync_views.py / tools/precedent_materialize.py pipeline
this repo already ships and already tests -- never a re-implementation of
source resolution. A REAL dependent repo works exactly the same way: attach
it, point --repo-root at its checkout (it needs its own precedent.json and
a synced AGENTS.md already, the way any real Precedent install does), and
everything below runs unchanged. Batches against different repos are
reported separately, never pooled into one score -- see "score" below.
