"""routing_eval.py — does trigger-based loading actually beat residency?

This is PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md's phase-2 done-when condition, the half
tools/behavioral_replay.py cannot reach. The replay proves the MECHANICAL
channel (path globs) is correct and cheaper. It says nothing about the
channel that routes 34 of the 46 on-demand practices: the occasion index's
prose. The plan is explicit that this is the assumption everything rests on:

    "This plan has hard evidence that residency does *not* produce
     compliance -- four defects from sessions carrying the relevant rule in
     context. It has no evidence yet that trigger-based loading does
     better. That is an assumption, not a finding... If triggering does not
     beat residency, the plan needs rethinking rather than building on."

V2, AND WHY V1'S NUMBER WAS NOT THE SYSTEM'S NUMBER. The first run scored
the treatment arm at a 52% miss rate against the control's 32%, and two of
its choices were responsible for a large part of that gap:

  - **It tested one channel out of three.** The plan's loader is a resident
    block PLUS an occasion index PLUS a path-triggered channel that fires
    automatically on the files being touched. v1 gave the treatment arm only
    the first two. Measured after the fact, `precedent_paths.py` surfaces
    8-9 practices per case on this case set, with no session judgment
    involved at all. Leaving it out did not make the test conservative, it
    made it wrong.
  - **It stopped after one hop.** The real sequence is: read the index, OPEN
    the candidates, read their Rules, then decide. v1 scored the arm on
    deciding from a one-line clause, because letting it read practices/
    freely would have let it sidestep the index under test. v2 runs the two
    hops as two separate sessions with the harness in between, so the arm
    gets exactly the Rules it asked for and nothing else -- the real system,
    with no way to cheat.

Both corrections cut in the treatment arm's favour, so v1's gap is an upper
bound on the real one, not an estimate of it.

THE DESIGN. Twenty real commits from this repo's own history, from before the
Precedent work began. For each, three sessions answer the same underlying
question -- which practices apply to this change? -- under three conditions:

  ORACLE     sees the full Rule catalogue and is asked ONLY to classify, one
             case at a time, with nothing else competing for attention. This
             is the ground truth. It is not an arm; it is the answer key.
  CONTROL    sees the full Rule catalogue and is asked to do the WORK, naming the
             practices it will apply. This is the pre-migration
             arrangement. The difference from the oracle is attention under
             task load, which is precisely the plan's thesis.
  TREATMENT  the real loader, in two hops.
             Hop 1 sees the resident block, the occasion index, AND the
             path-triggered channel's output for the files this change
             touches, and names the practices it wants to open.
             Hop 2 sees exactly those Rules -- resolved by this harness, not
             fetched by the agent -- and gives the final answer.

Neither treatment hop has repository access. The arm cannot read practices/
and sidestep the very index under test; it can only ask, and be given what
it asked for. That is the system as built, with the cheating path closed.

COST IS PART OF THE ANSWER, NOT A FOOTNOTE. The goal is to miss few or no
applicable practices WITHOUT carrying the whole catalogue in context. An arm
that surfaces everything by loading everything has not solved the problem it
was built for. So every arm's prompt is measured in tokens and reported
beside its miss rate: the question is recall per token, not recall.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SETTLE. It measures routing -- whether the right
practices are surfaced. It does not measure whether a session then follows
a practice it surfaced. Ten cases is a pilot: it can show a large effect,
and it cannot resolve a small one. Both limits are printed with the result
rather than left to the reader.

# about what to open), so this arm reads the loader's hop-1 context in one
# shot rather than replaying a request/open cycle whose second half was never
