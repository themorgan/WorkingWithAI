"""checkin.py — drive the periodic check-in (INSTALL.md §4) mechanically.

Runs from a dependent repo (script lives at process/upstream/tools/). The
check-in loop — sync the vendored tree into a clone of the upstream repo,
land it there, then record the landed commit in the manifest — was performed
by hand several times and each pass repeated the same steps with the same
two failure modes: forgetting the scrub before content left the private
repo, and recording a hash that didn't actually match the tree that landed.
Per the convention-becomes-audit rule, the steps are now a tool; every
mutation it performs is gated by a check that fails loudly.

Four subcommands — update takes upstream changes IN, the other three drive
a check-in OUT:

  status <upstream-clone>   Compare the vendored tree against the clone's
                            working tree: list Added/Modified/Deleted files
                            (vendored perspective), show the manifest's
                            recorded upstream.commit vs the clone's HEAD.
                            Exit 1 if the trees differ (so it can gate).

  update <upstream-clone> [--force]
                            The INSTALL.md §2 direction: pull the clone's
                            default branch and mirror it into the vendored
                            tree. REFUSES if the vendored tree differs from
                            the recorded upstream.commit — that difference
                            is unexported local work the mirror would
                            silently clobber; export it first (§3/§4) or
                            pass --force to overwrite. (Origin: a session
                            hand-rolled this mirror with git archive | tar
                            — rsync is absent in hosted containers, as of
                            2026-08 — and a stale local default-branch ref
                            nearly mirrored an old tree; the tool pulls
                            fresh and guards the overwrite.)

  push <upstream-clone> [--force]
                            REFUSES if upstream's default branch has moved
                            past what the vendored tree was mirrored from —
                            the tree is then behind, and this mirror DELETES
                            files it lacks, so it would revert upstream work
                            (run `update` first). Then run the scrub/practice
                            audit — it must
                            pass, THIS is the gate that keeps proprietary
                            content out of the public repo — then mirror the
                            vendored tree into the clone's working tree
                            (deleting files that no longer exist upstream,
                            .git untouched). Committing, opening the PR, and
                            merging remain deliberate manual steps: the PR
                            review is the second scrub line.

  record <upstream-clone> [--note "..."]
                            After the upstream merge: pull the clone's
                            default branch, verify it is byte-identical to
                            the vendored tree (fail loudly if not — never
                            record a hash that doesn't match the tree), then
                            write the clone's HEAD hash into
                            process/manifest.json upstream.commit. Commit
                            the manifest change in the dependent repo
                            yourself.

  fresh                     Clone-free staleness notice for session starts:
                            one `git ls-remote` of the manifest's upstream
                            repo, compared to the recorded upstream.commit.
                            Prints one line only when upstream has moved;
                            always exits 0 (a notice, never a gate) and
                            stays silent on network failure — detection is
                            automated, taking the update stays deliberate
                            (INSTALL.md sec.2).

    Tells two failure modes apart. A genuinely unreachable remote (offline,

    But a fast, clean `git ls-remote` failure (non-zero exit — no

    not found") is a different thing: the check did not run, not that it
