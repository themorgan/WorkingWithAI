## Rule
In any document that walks through instructions, guidance, or rules
in multiple sections, order the sections by how often and how urgently the
reader will actually need them — common, everyday content first; rare edge
cases, migration scenarios, and "if the world changes" contingencies last —
unless the subject matter itself dictates a different order (steps that must
be followed in sequence, a narrative that only makes sense in one direction).
The test: would most readers have to scroll past this section to reach the
one they actually opened the document for?

## Detail

## Why
A document is drafted in the order its author thought it through,
which is rarely the order its reader needs it in. An edge case sits next to
the common case that motivated it, in the author's head, and that adjacency
survives into the draft even though almost no reader will ever hit the edge
case — they just have to read past it every time.

## Story

## Install
A writing convention, checked in review with the question
above; part of [templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template)'s
Conventions section. No mechanical audit — "which order serves most readers"
is a judgment call, not a pattern a lint can reliably detect.
