## Rule
Every dependent repo installs a default pull-request template
covering what changed, why, files touched, and the practices' own
living-document gates (scrub, MAP, TODO, GLOSSARY) as a checklist. The body
is written from the actual diff; a gate is checked only when it is actually
true for this change. An unchecked box, or a "not applicable" note, is a
normal and expected outcome — never a defect to paper over.

## Detail

## Why
A template with a fixed checklist is worth nothing the moment
filling it in becomes reflex: "N/A" typed into every box looks exactly like
verification happened and means nothing did. The template earns its place
only paired with an explicit instruction that unchecked boxes are fine — the
alternative trains exactly the behavior the checklist exists to catch.

## Story

## Install
[templates/pull_request_template.md.template](templates/pull_request_template.md.template)
→ `.github/pull_request_template.md` — installed the same way as `AGENTS.md`
(§1), propagated to existing installs the same way (§2). The "write from the
diff, unchecked is fine" instruction lives in
[templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template) so every
session opening a PR sees it, not just the template itself.
