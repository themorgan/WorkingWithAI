## Rule
A heading or lead-in that names a form or length must match what it
actually introduces. Do not title something "in one line" / "one-pager" / "in
one paragraph" / "TL;DR" unless it literally is that. If a section runs to a
page, name it for its content, not for a brevity it doesn't have.

## Detail

## Why

## Story
"The thesis in one line" sat atop three paragraphs; "the business
model in one line each" atop multi-line bullets. The label over-promises,
and a reader who trusts it feels misled the moment they read on — the same
credibility leak as a numeric claim that doesn't match its source. It reads
as spin in a document whose whole job is to be trusted.

## Install
A writing convention in the project instructions; catch it in
document review. The fix is almost always to rename the label to its content
("The thesis"), not to compress the content to the label.
