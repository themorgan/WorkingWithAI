## Rule
Every expensive environment discovery (a package that must be
installed, a tool that silently doesn't work, a path that does work) is
written into a "do NOT rediscover these" section — with the story of what
failed and why, not just the fix.

## Detail

## Why

## Story
A build tool once failed on every input with a misleading error; two
full sessions were lost to "this tool is broken" lore before someone found the
one missing package. Once the fix *and the story* were written down, the
failure never recurred — and the story is what lets a future session judge
whether the note still applies.

## Install
A gotchas section in the instructions file
([templates/AGENTS.md.template](templates/AGENTS.md.template)), plus
[session-bootstrap](session-bootstrap.md) (encode the fixes as a bootstrap hook so they apply themselves).
