## Rule
A document that summarizes a body of work for an external audience
carries three things. **(a) A claims-to-source table**: every quantitative
claim mapped to the living source that backs it — this is what makes
verification cheap enough to actually run. **(b) Honest aggregation**: any
sum over rows drawn from different sources names its rows and states its
dedupe rule beside the sum, after reading each row's defining prose for
inclusion statements (rows with different names are not additive until
proven additive); and in any companion computation, a revenue or benefit
line names its enabling condition and the computation either carries that
enabler's cost or excludes the line. **(c) A recorded adversarial pass
before external use**: claim-vs-source verification plus a cross-document
consistency sweep, run adversarially (a subtly different range counts as a
finding), with findings, resolutions, and the open tail written to a dated
diligence record. The record is part of the deliverable.

**(d) Run the pass automatically, in the same working session, before
reporting the work done** — do not queue it, offer it as an option, or defer
it to "before external use".

## Detail
Only genuinely external blockers (an unreachable source, a number needing a
field measurement) stay open, listed as the open tail rather than used to
postpone the pass. **(e) A correction that moves numbers in the author's own
favour carries its justification in writing** — that direction needs the
most scrutiny, not the least. **(f) When a model composes two agents with
different characteristic times, check the slower one's cycle time against
the faster one's before costing the composition** — a cost model can be
dimensionally perfect and still describe an operation that cannot be
performed. **(g) When comparing alternatives, check that each side's
standing/availability cost is charged, or that neither is** — marginal-only
costing of a human alternative against a capital alternative that already
carries its overhead is the commonest one-sided comparison, and it flatters
whichever side the author owns. **(h) State which technology generation the
incumbent is allowed to use.** Costing your automated proposal against a
manual incumbent compares your future to their present. Give the incumbent
the same generation of technology your own case assumes, and where you claim
an asymmetry — that a rule or a physical constraint permits your automation
but not theirs — justify it from the environment rather than from
convenience, and say which regime each finding belongs to. **(i) When a
term's sign or direction is the claim being made, compute it — do not reason
about which way it goes.** Directional assertions about a model's own terms
are the easiest thing to get backwards and the hardest to notice, because
they sound like understanding.

## Why
Deferred verification is verification that does not happen: the session that
wrote the analysis is the one that still holds the reasoning, and a later
session inherits the conclusions without the context that would let it
attack them.

The lesson generalises past cost models: a pass that only re-reads reasoning
reproduces its errors, while one that re-computes the disputed quantity does
not.

## Story
The same audit that produced [quote-discipline](quote-discipline.md) found twenty-two defects in a
summary whose every number had been written in good faith from real sources:
three differently-named rows summing one underlying market, a benefit line
booked without its gating cost, claims citing documents that did not contain
them, and stale values the sources had since revised. The claims-to-source
table let two independent reviewers verify thirty claims in minutes —
without it the pass would have been unaffordable and would not have
happened. The diligence record then made every fix auditable and left an
honest open-items tail the next revision inherits, converting a one-off
cleanup into a repeatable gate. Clauses (d)–(f) came later, from the
principal's standing direction after a second analysis shipped with its pass
queued rather than run ("I don't care about unchecked work"): the pass that
was then run immediately found that the model had silently assumed a
composite operation neither participant had time to perform — a defect no
amount of source-checking would have surfaced, because every input was
correct and only their *composition in time* was impossible. Clause (g) came
from the principal's next question — whether the human alternative's
availability cost had been modelled. It had not, while the authored side's
equivalent overhead was already charged; the omission was invisible because
each side's own numbers were internally consistent. Clause (h) followed
immediately: the same reviewer asked whether the manual incumbent should
have been allowed to automate too. It should — and modelling it removed most
of the proposal's advantage, leaving a narrower but defensible claim. The
three questions form a family: whether the composed parts fit in *time*,
whether both sides carry their *standing* costs, and whether both are costed
at the same *technology generation*. A fourth round added clause (i) after
the author's own answer to a reviewer's challenge asserted, confidently and
backwards, which way one of the model's terms inverted — inside the very
pass meant to be checking the work.
